# Security Hardening and Secure Coding

## OWASP Top 10 (2021) -- Overview and Practical Mitigations

### A01: Broken Access Control
- Deny by default. Enforce server-side authorization on every request.
- Use RBAC or ABAC. Disable directory listing. Log repeated access-control failures.

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- Encrypt PII at rest (AES-256-GCM) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- Hash passwords with bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2id. Rotate encryption keys on schedule.

### A03: Injection
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database access.
- Validate and sanitize every input server-side. Use ORMs with parameterized bindings.

### A04: Insecure Design
- Threat model (STRIDE, DREAD) during design. Apply least privilege, defense in depth, fail-safe defaults.

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- Remove default credentials and debug endpoints in production. Automate configuration audits.

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Maintain an SBOM. Run dependency scanning in CI. Subscribe to security advisories.

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- Enforce strong passwords (12+ characters, check breached-password lists). Require MFA for privileged accounts.
- Regenerate session IDs after login. Set short idle timeouts.

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Verify dependency integrity via lockfiles and checksums. Sign commits and releases.

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Log auth attempts, authorization failures, and privilege changes. Centralize logs. Never log secrets or PII.

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Allowlist URLs before server-side requests. Block private IP ranges. Use network-level controls.

---

## Input Validation

Always validate on the server side. Client-side validation is a convenience for users, not a security control.

### Principles
- Prefer allowlists over denylists. Define what is permitted, reject everything else.
- Validate type, length, range, and format for every input field.
- Reject unexpected input early, before it reaches business logic or data stores.
- Canonicalize inputs before validation (decode URL encoding, normalize Unicode).

### Example: Server-Side Validation

```javascript
// Allowlist approach: only permit expected characters
function validateUsername(input) {
  const ALLOWED = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,30}$/;
  if (!ALLOWED.test(input)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid username format');
  }
  return input;
}

// Numeric validation with range checking
function validateAge(input) {
  const age = Number(input);
  if (!Number.isInteger(age) || age < 0 || age > 150) {
    throw new Error('Invalid age');
  }
  return age;
}
```

---

## SQL Injection Prevention

### Parameterized Queries

```javascript
// VULNERABLE: string concatenation
const result = db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`);

// SAFE: parameterized query
const result = db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [req.params.id]);
```

```python
# VULNERABLE
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'")

# SAFE: parameterized
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s", (email,))
```

### ORM Usage
- ORMs generate parameterized queries by default. Use query builders instead of raw SQL.
- When raw SQL is required, still use parameterized bindings. Audit ORM queries in development.

---

## XSS Prevention

### Output Encoding
- Encode all dynamic content before inserting into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or URL contexts.
- Use context-aware encoding: HTML entity encoding for HTML body, JavaScript escaping for script contexts, URL encoding for URL parameters.

```javascript
// HTML context: encode before insertion
function escapeHtml(str) {
  return str
    .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
    .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
    .replace(/'/g, '&#x27;');
}
```

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Deploy CSP headers to restrict sources of scripts, styles, images, and other resources.
- Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`. Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts when necessary.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

### Sanitization
- For user-supplied HTML (rich text editors), use a proven library (DOMPurify, bleach). Never write custom sanitizers.
- Strip `javascript:` URIs, event handler attributes, and dangerous elements (`<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`).

---

## CSRF Protection

### Token-Based Protection
- Generate a unique, unpredictable CSRF token per session. Include in a hidden form field or custom header.
- Validate server-side on every state-changing request. Regenerate tokens on login.

### SameSite Cookies
- Set `SameSite=Lax` as a minimum on all session cookies. Use `SameSite=Strict` where cross-site navigation is not needed.
- Combine SameSite with CSRF tokens for defense in depth. SameSite alone does not cover all browsers or scenarios.

```
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/
```

---

## Security Headers

Apply these headers to every HTTP response in production.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
```

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Content-Security-Policy | Controls which resources the browser may load. Primary defense against XSS. |
| Strict-Transport-Security | Forces HTTPS for all future requests. Prevents protocol downgrade attacks. |
| X-Frame-Options | Prevents clickjacking by blocking framing of the page. |
| X-Content-Type-Options | Stops browsers from MIME-sniffing responses away from the declared content type. |
| Referrer-Policy | Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests. |
| Permissions-Policy | Restricts which browser features (camera, mic, geolocation) the page may use. |

---

## CORS Configuration

- Default to the most restrictive policy: do not set CORS headers unless cross-origin access is required.
- Never use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. Browsers reject this, but the intent reveals a misunderstanding.
- Allowlist specific origins. Validate the `Origin` header against the allowlist on every request.
- Restrict `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to only what is needed.

```javascript
// Express example: explicit origin allowlist
const allowedOrigins = ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com'];

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const origin = req.headers.origin;
  if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  }
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  next();
});
```

---

## Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

- Apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints, password reset, and API routes.
- Use sliding window or token bucket algorithms. Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After`.
- Implement account lockout after repeated failures (e.g., 5 failures in 10 minutes, 15-minute lockout).
- Rate limit by IP, by account, and by API key independently. Consider CAPTCHA after threshold failures.

---

## File Upload Security

### Validation
- Validate file type by inspecting magic bytes, not just extension or client-provided MIME type.
- Enforce maximum file size at web server and application level. Allowlist permitted extensions.

### Storage
- Store uploads outside the web root. Rename to random UUIDs; never use the original filename.
- Scan uploads for malware (ClamAV or equivalent).

### Serving
- Set `Content-Disposition: attachment` for downloads. Serve uploads from a separate domain.
- Set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-type sniffing.

---

## Environment Variable Security

### .env Files
- Never commit `.env` files. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` before the first commit.
- Provide `.env.example` with placeholder values. Restrict file permissions in production (`chmod 600`).

### Secrets Management
- Use a dedicated secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) in production.
- Rotate secrets on schedule and after any suspected compromise. Never log secrets.
- Prefer short-lived, scoped credentials (IAM roles, OIDC tokens) over static API keys.

### Pre-Commit Checks
- Use git-secrets, TruffleHog, or gitleaks in pre-commit hooks.
- Scan full repo history periodically; removed secrets persist in git history.

---

## Dependency Security

- Run `npm audit`, `pip audit`, or equivalent on every CI build. Fail on high/critical vulnerabilities.
- Enable Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency update PRs.
- Use Snyk or Socket for transitive dependency and supply chain analysis.
- Commit lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`) and review changes to them.
- Pin dependency versions in production. Audit new dependencies before adding them.

---

## Docker Security

### Image Construction
- Use minimal base images (`alpine`, `distroless`, `scratch`) to reduce attack surface.
- Run processes as a non-root user. Add a `USER` instruction in the Dockerfile.
- Use multi-stage builds to exclude build tools and source code from the final image.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine
RUN addgroup -S app && adduser -S app -G app
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

### Secrets and Scanning
- Never embed secrets in images (ENV, ARG, or COPY). They persist in image layers.
- Pass secrets at runtime via mounted volumes or orchestrator secrets (Kubernetes Secrets, Docker Swarm).
- Scan images with Trivy, Grype, or Snyk Container.

---

## HTTPS Everywhere

- Enforce TLS 1.2 minimum; prefer TLS 1.3. Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS with 301.
- Deploy HSTS with `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`. Submit to hstspreload.org.
- Use strong cipher suites. Disable CBC-mode ciphers and anything below 128-bit.
- Automate certificate renewal (Let's Encrypt/certbot). Test with SSL Labs for an A+ rating.

---

## Logging Security Events

### What to Log
- Authentication successes and failures (username, IP, timestamp; never passwords).
- Authorization failures, input validation failures, privilege escalation events, and admin actions.

### How to Log Safely
- Use structured logging (JSON). Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, or PII.
- Send logs to a centralized system (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch, Datadog). Set retention policies.
- Alert on anomalous patterns: spikes in failed logins, unusual data access volumes.

---

## Server Hardening

### SSH Configuration
- Disable password authentication; use SSH key pairs only. Disable root login (`PermitRootLogin no`).
- Use `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` to restrict SSH access. Enable fail2ban to block brute force attempts.

### Firewall Basics
- Default-deny inbound traffic. Open only required ports (22, 80, 443).
- Restrict management ports to specific IP ranges or VPN. Log denied connections.

### General Hardening
- Disable unused services and uninstall unnecessary packages. Automate OS patching.
- Enable SELinux or AppArmor. Set filesystem permissions following least privilege.

---

## Secrets Management

### HashiCorp Vault
- Access secrets via the Vault API. Authenticate using AppRole, Kubernetes auth, or cloud IAM.
- Use dynamic secrets (short-lived database credentials on demand). Enable audit logging.

### AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager / Azure Key Vault
- Store secrets in the cloud provider's manager. Use IAM policies to restrict access. Enable auto-rotation.

### Environment-Based Secrets (When No Secrets Manager Is Available)
- Inject secrets as environment variables at deploy time via CI/CD or orchestrator.
- Never bake secrets into images, version-controlled config, or client-side code.
- Rotate immediately after team member departure or suspected leak.
