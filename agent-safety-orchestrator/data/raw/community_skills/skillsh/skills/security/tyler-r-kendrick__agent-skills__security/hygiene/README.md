# Hygiene

Use when enforcing defensive coding practices that treat all data as untrusted — regardless of source. Covers sanitization, canonicalization, encoding, and validation of inputs AND outputs at every component boundary, including internal databases, caches, message queues, and inter-service calls.

## Structure

|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Agent skill definition (frontmatter + instructions) |
| `metadata.json` | Machine-readable metadata and versioning |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent-optimized quick reference (generated) |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `rules/` | 10 individual best practice rules |
