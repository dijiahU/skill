# Skill Auditor

> Analyze agent skills for security risks, malicious patterns, and potential dangers before installation.

## Highlights

- Scans for dangerous code patterns (shell commands, network calls, obfuscation, credential access)
- Detects prompt injection attempts hidden in skill files
- Supports local paths, GitHub URLs, and `npx skills add` commands as input
- Produces detailed security reports with contextual risk analysis
- Offers installation after safe verdicts

## When to Use

| Say this... | Skill will... |
|---|---|
| "audit a skill" | Run full security analysis on a skill directory |
| "is this skill safe?" | Scan for risks and deliver install/reject verdict |
| "npx skills add https://..." | Intercept install, audit first, then offer installation |
| "check skill security" | Analyze scripts, references, and instructions for threats |
| "scan this skill" | Full file inventory and pattern-based risk analysis |
