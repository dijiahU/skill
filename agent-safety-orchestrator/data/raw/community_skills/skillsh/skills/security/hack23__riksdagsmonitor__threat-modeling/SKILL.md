# Threat Modeling Skill


## 🔴 AI FIRST Quality Principle

> **Apply the AI FIRST principle: never accept first-pass quality. Minimum 2 iterations. Read all output, improve every section. No shortcuts.**

## Purpose

This skill embodies the complete Hack23 AB threat modeling methodology as defined in [ISMS Threat_Modeling.md](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Threat_Modeling.md). It provides systematic threat identification, risk quantification, and security control validation for proactive security assurance across all Hack23 projects.

**Key Philosophy**: "Security through transparency" - All threat models are publicly documented to demonstrate security excellence to clients, regulators, and the open-source community.

## Hack23 Threat Modeling Process (ISMS § 4)

## Attack Tree Analysis (ISMS § 4.6)

Attack trees are **mandatory** for all Hack23 threat models per ISMS policy. They provide:

### Purpose
- Visual decomposition of attack paths from goal to sub-goals
- AND/OR relationship mapping between attack steps
- Success probability calculation for attack paths
- Critical path identification for mitigation prioritization

### Attack Tree Structure

```
Root: Attack Goal (e.g., "Compromise Application")
├── OR Gate: Any child succeeds → parent succeeds
│   ├── AND Gate: All children must succeed → parent succeeds
│   │   ├── Leaf: Individual attack step (Likelihood: 40%, Impact: High)
│   │   └── Leaf: Individual attack step (Likelihood: 60%, Impact: Medium)
│   └── AND Gate: Alternative attack path
│       ├── Leaf: Attack step 1
│       └── Leaf: Attack step 2
└── OR Gate: Second major attack vector
    └── Leaf: Direct attack
```

### Example: Static Website Compromise (from Riksdagsmonitor)
```
Root: Compromise Riksdagsmonitor Platform
├── OR: Infrastructure Attack
│   ├── AND: DNS Hijacking
│   │   ├── Compromise Route 53 credentials (Likelihood: 10%, Impact: Critical)
│   │   └── Modify DNS records (Likelihood: 95%, Impact: Critical)
│   └── AND: S3 Bucket Compromise
│       ├── Find misconfigured bucket (Likelihood: 5%, Impact: High)
│       └── Upload malicious content (Likelihood: 90%, Impact: High)
└── OR: Supply Chain Attack
    ├── AND: Compromise GitHub Account
    │   ├── Steal developer credentials (Likelihood: 15%, Impact: Critical)
    │   └── Bypass MFA (Likelihood: 20%, Impact: Critical)
    └── AND: Malicious Dependency Injection
        ├── Compromise npm package (Likelihood: 5%, Impact: High)
        └── Inject malicious code (Likelihood: 80%, Impact: Critical)
```

### Attack Tree Analysis Steps
1. **Goal Identification**: Define attacker objectives
2. **Path Decomposition**: Break down into AND/OR sub-goals
3. **Leaf Node Likelihood**: Assign success probability (1-100%)
4. **Impact Assessment**: Use Classification Framework
5. **Path Calculation**: Calculate cumulative success likelihood
6. **Critical Path**: Identify highest risk paths
7. **Mitigation Priority**: Focus on high-likelihood, high-impact leaves

### Integration with STRIDE
Each STRIDE threat should have corresponding attack tree showing exploitation paths.

## Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

### DFD Elements
- **External Entity**: Sources/sinks of data (users, external systems)
- **Process**: Data transformation or computation
- **Data Store**: Persistent storage
- **Data Flow**: Movement between elements
- **Trust Boundary**: Security domain separation

### STRIDE per DFD Element
| Element | Applicable STRIDE Threats |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **External Entity** | Spoofing, Repudiation |
| **Process** | All 6 STRIDE categories |
| **Data Store** | Tampering, Information Disclosure, DoS |
| **Data Flow** | Tampering, Information Disclosure, DoS |
| **Trust Boundary** | Elevation of Privilege |

## Quantitative Risk Assessment

### Risk Calculation
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

### Likelihood Scoring
- **Critical (5)**: Near certain (>90%)
- **High (4)**: Likely (60-90%)
- **Medium (3)**: Possible (30-60%)
- **Low (2)**: Unlikely (10-30%)
- **Negligible (1)**: Rare (<10%)

### Impact Scoring (per Classification Framework)
- **Critical (5)**: >$10K daily, complete outage, criminal charges
- **High (4)**: $5K-10K daily, major degradation, significant fines
- **Medium (3)**: $1K-5K daily, moderate impact, compliance violations
- **Low (2)**: $500-1K daily, minor impact, warnings
- **Negligible (1)**: <$500 daily, minimal impact, no regulatory

### Risk Matrix
| Likelihood → Impact | Negligible (1) | Low (2) | Medium (3) | High (4) | Critical (5) |
|--------------------|----------------|---------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Critical (5)** | Medium | High | High | Critical | Critical |
| **High (4)** | Medium | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| **Medium (3)** | Low | Medium | Medium | High | High |
| **Low (2)** | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Negligible (1)** | Low | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |

## Best Practices & Quality Standards

### ✅ Do's
1. **Start Early**: Threat model during design phase, not after implementation
2. **Use All 5 Strategies**: Attacker, Asset, Architecture, Scenario, Risk-centric
3. **Quantify Risk**: Use likelihood × impact matrix, not just qualitative assessment
4. **Document Visually**: Mermaid DFDs, attack trees, risk matrices
5. **Link Everything**: Cross-reference SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md, Risk_Register.md
6. **Business Value**: Quantify cost avoidance, competitive advantage
7. **Public Transparency**: All threat models public (security through transparency)
8. **Continuous Updates**: Threat landscape evolves, models must too
9. **Attack Trees Mandatory**: Minimum 3-5 trees per ISMS § 4.6
10. **MITRE ATT&CK Required**: Map tactics/techniques per ISMS § 4.6

### ❌ Don'ts
1. **Skip Attack Trees**: ISMS § 4.6 requires attack tree analysis
2. **Generic Threats**: Customize to actual system architecture
3. **Ignore Low Risks**: Document all risks, even accepted ones
4. **One-Time Activity**: Threat modeling is continuous, not one-and-done
5. **Missing Controls**: Every threat needs control or risk acceptance
6. **No Quantification**: Risk scores required, not just High/Medium/Low
7. **Siloed Analysis**: Integrate with ISMS policies (Access Control, Crypto, Network)
8. **Forget Business Value**: Security is business enabler, quantify benefits
9. **Incomplete Documentation**: Follow mandatory structure § 5 completely
10. **No CEO Approval**: All threat models require CEO sign-off

### 2. CEO Purpose Statement
Quote from CEO James Pether Sörling connecting threat modeling to Hack23's transparency and security excellence principles:

> *"At Hack23, we believe that true security comes through transparency and demonstrable practices. This threat model is publicly available to showcase our proactive security posture, allowing clients and stakeholders to verify our commitment to security excellence. By openly documenting our threat analysis, we demonstrate not just what we protect, but how we protect it."*

- Residual risk level
- Major findings and recommendations

### 4. System Boundary and Assets (ISMS § 5.1)
- **System Components**: Mermaid diagram showing architecture with trust boundaries
- **Assets**: Table with Asset, Type, Classification (per Classification Framework), Value
- **Trust Boundaries**: List all trust boundary crossings

### 5. STRIDE Threat Analysis (ISMS § 5.2)
For each STRIDE category (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege):
- **Threat Description**: What the threat is
- **Attack Vector**: How it's exploited
- **Likelihood**: Low/Medium/High/Critical (1-5 score)
- **Impact**: Based on Classification Framework (1-5 score)
- **Risk Score**: Likelihood × Impact
- **Current Controls**: Existing mitigations
- **Residual Risk**: After controls
- **Recommendations**: Additional mitigations needed

### 6. Attack Tree Analysis (ISMS § 5.3) - **MANDATORY**
Minimum 3-5 attack trees showing major attack scenarios:
- Root goal (e.g., "Compromise Application")
- AND/OR gate structure
- Leaf nodes with success likelihood
- Visual representation in Mermaid or text format
- Critical path identification

### 7. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (ISMS § 5.4) - **MANDATORY**
Map applicable tactics and techniques:
- **Tactic**: MITRE ATT&CK tactic (e.g., Initial Access, Execution)
- **Technique**: Specific technique ID (e.g., T1566 - Phishing)
- **Sub-Technique**: If applicable
- **System Component**: Where it applies
- **Detection**: How to detect
- **Mitigation**: How to prevent

### 8. Risk Assessment Summary (ISMS § 5.5)
- **Risk Matrix**: Visual Likelihood × Impact matrix
- **Risk Distribution**: Count of Critical/High/Medium/Low risks
- **Risk Treatment Decisions**: Per threat (Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept)
- **Residual Risk Justification**: Why remaining risk is acceptable

### 9. Security Controls (ISMS § 5.6)
Reference **SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md** with:
- Control categories (Preventive, Detective, Corrective)
- Implementation status
- Control effectiveness rating
- Control gaps and roadmap

### 10. Business Value Integration (ISMS § 5.7) - **REQUIRED**
Quantify security business value:
- 🏆 **Competitive Advantage**: Market differentiation through transparent security
- 🤝 **Customer Trust**: Demonstrable security posture
- 💰 **Cost Avoidance**: Prevented incident costs (quantify)
- 🔄 **Operational Excellence**: Reduced security overhead
- 💡 **Innovation Enablement**: Secure experimentation
- 🛡️ **Risk Reduction**: Quantitative risk reduction percentage

### 11. Compliance Mapping (ISMS § 5.8)
Map threats and controls to:
- **ISO 27001:2022**: Relevant Annex A controls
- **NIST CSF 2.0**: Functions and categories
- **CIS Controls v8.1**: Applicable controls
- **AWS Well-Architected**: For AWS projects
