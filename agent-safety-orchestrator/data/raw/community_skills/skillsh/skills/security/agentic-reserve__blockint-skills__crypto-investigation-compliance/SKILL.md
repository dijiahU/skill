# Crypto investigation and compliance awareness

Educational workflow guidance only. **Not** legal advice. Do **not** assist with laundering, sanctions evasion, harassment, or non-consensual deanonymization.

## Crypto crime — conceptual map (high level)

**Crypto crime** spans theft, fraud, laundering, ransomware, sanctions evasion, terrorist financing, market abuse, and more. Responses blend **chain tracing**, **OSINT**, and **legal** process.

**Common terms (non-exhaustive):**

- **Pig butchering** — long-build trust → fake investment platform  
- **Rug pull** — insiders drain or abandon  
- **Ponzi / yield scam** — returns from new money  
- **DeFi exploit / bridge hack** — contract or infra failure  
- **Mixer / tumbler** — trail obfuscation (lawful privacy vs illicit use is context-specific)  
- **Drainer / phishing** — malicious signing  
- **Pump-and-dump / wash trading** — manipulation  

Chains attract misuse due to **pseudonymity**, **speed**, **cross-border** reach, **programmability**; obfuscation complicates but rarely perfects hiding.

**Victims:** report quickly via **official** national cybercrime channels where applicable; on-chain timelines can support **law enforcement** filings—check **local** rules.

## CEX deposits, stablecoins, and off-chain gaps

- **Exchange deposits and withdrawals** — On-chain you often see transfers into a labeled hot-wallet cluster; tying that to a specific customer account usually requires exchange cooperation or legal process—do not treat analytics labels as proof alone.
- **Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.)** — Track mints, burns, and large transfers on-chain; issuer blacklists and freezes are not fully observable from public RPC alone.
- **Documentation** — Separate on-chain facts from what requires custodial or legal follow-up.

## Ethical investigation workflow

1. **Anchor** — hashes, addresses, contracts, amounts, times  
2. **Explore** — explorers; contract path  
3. **Cluster** — treat as probabilistic (see **address-clustering-attribution**)  
4. **Attribute cautiously** — strong evidence only  
5. **Document** — sources, fact vs inference  
6. **Escalate** — professionals / authorities for recovery  

**Do not:** doxx, accuse without evidence, bypass legal process.
