name: audit-dead-code
description: Find dead code and cleanup candidates such as unused exports, unreachable branches, orphaned files, stale feature flags, dead registrations, and compatibility layers with no live callers. Use when auditing refactors, bundle-size cleanup, architecture simplification, pre-release cleanup, reviewing requests to find unused code or decide what can be deleted, or when deciding whether code can be safely removed or auto-fixed.

# Audit Dead Code

Audit reachability before deleting anything. Build a proof chain from live entrypoint to candidate, then apply the smallest safe removal.

## Follow this workflow

1. Map the codebase entrypoints, public surfaces, and dynamic loading surfaces in scope.
2. Search for references from public surfaces inward, not just from the candidate itself.
3. Classify each candidate as unused export, unreachable code, orphaned file, stale feature flag, dead registration, or legacy compatibility path.
4. Build a proof chain with code search, config or registry checks, framework conventions, and typecheck, build, or tests where available.
5. Prioritize findings as `P1` through `P4`.
6. Auto-fix only local, low-risk removals. Leave broader deletions as findings with a concrete removal plan.

## Map live entrypoints first

Do not start deleting from leaf files without understanding how code can be reached.

Inspect the relevant equivalents of:

- routes, controllers, pages, and API handlers
- package exports, workspace boundaries, and public modules
- CLI commands and scheduled jobs
- queues, workers, and event subscribers
- dependency-injection or service-container registration
- framework auto-discovery and naming conventions
- plugin manifests, registries, and config-driven loading
- dynamic imports, reflection, and string-based dispatch
- tests, fixtures, storybook stories, and demo apps
- build scripts, codegen inputs, and release tooling

Dead code claims are weak until these entrypoints are checked.

## Search for dead-code signals

Start with the language-appropriate equivalents of:

- `import`
- `require`
- `export`
- `public`
- `function`
- `class`
- `interface`
- `type`
- `const`
- `enum`
- `if (false)`
- `if (FLAG)`
- `else`
- `switch`
- `default`
- `return`
- `throw`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `deprecated`
- `legacy`
- `TODO remove`
- `unused`
- `feature flag`
- `register`
- `route`
- `command`

Also inspect:

- files with no inbound imports
- modules imported only by other suspected-dead modules
- modules re-exported but never consumed
- path aliases, barrels, or registries that may hide the last live reference
- duplicate implementations behind old/new paths
- branches gated by flags that are permanently on or off
- code after unconditional `return`, `throw`, or exhaustive matches
- adapters kept only for migrations that already finished

## Build a proof chain

Treat "no references found" as a starting signal, not proof.

Prefer at least two independent pieces of evidence when possible:

- repo search shows no live callers after checking aliases, barrels, generated paths, and test-only consumers
- no route, command, registry, manifest, config, or package export points at the candidate
- framework conventions and auto-discovery rules do not require it by name or location
- removing it keeps typecheck, build, and targeted tests green when those checks exist
- feature-flag source of truth shows the branch is permanently on or off
- public-surface review finds no external or cross-workspace consumers you can verify

If evidence depends on a system you cannot inspect locally, downgrade the claim to a finding with missing proof instead of deleting.

## Detect these dead-code patterns

### Unused exports

Flag exported values that have no live consumers.

Common signals:

- exported helper, component, hook, class, or constant with zero references outside its file
- barrel exports that expose symbols never imported anywhere
- public methods required by no interface, subclass, or framework hook
- package exports left behind after an internal refactor

Verify framework conventions before deleting. Some exports are consumed by reflection, auto-registration, templates, external packages, or sibling workspaces.

### Unreachable code

Flag code paths that normal execution cannot enter.

Common signals:

- statements after `return`, `throw`, `break`, or `continue`
- `if` or `switch` branches guarded by impossible conditions
- fallback branches after exhaustive enum or union handling
- code behind version checks or environment gates that can no longer occur

Prefer proving why the branch is impossible, not just that it looks suspicious.

### Orphaned files

Flag files, directories, or modules with no live entrypoint.

Common signals:

- module not imported, registered, routed, or referenced by config
- page, component, job, or worker replaced by a new implementation but never removed
- fixture, test helper, or mock file not referenced by any tests
- scripts that are no longer invoked by package scripts, CI, cron, or docs

Check for out-of-repo or cross-workspace consumers before deleting shared packages or public artifacts.

### Stale feature flags

Flag flags whose rollout is finished but both paths still remain.

Common signals:

- flag is always on or always off in current config
- old branch is still present long after migration or launch
- flag name includes a completed rollout, migration, or temporary workaround
- kill switch exists but no owner, expiry, or current use remains

Confirm the source of truth for the flag. Code search alone is not enough if flags are managed remotely.

### Dead registrations and compatibility layers

Flag code kept only to support paths that no longer exist.

Common signals:

- event listeners subscribed to events no producer emits
- adapters for old payload shapes after all producers migrated
- deprecated routes, commands, or aliases with no callers
- serializer fields kept for clients that no longer exist

These often survive because the registration site looks live even though the upstream caller is gone.

## Guard against false positives

Dead-code audits are easy to get wrong where usage is indirect.

Be careful around:

- reflection and runtime method lookup
- DI container resolution by string or class name
- framework auto-discovery by filename or folder
- dynamic imports and lazy loading
- package exports, CLI `bin` entries, or monorepo workspace consumers
- generated registries, manifests, or codegen that recreate the reference chain
- templates that reference symbols indirectly
- code generation inputs and generated outputs
- public SDK or package APIs consumed outside the repo
- migrations, backfills, and historical one-off scripts that are intentionally retained
- feature flags controlled in remote dashboards or environment management

If reachability depends on conventions or external systems, report the finding with the missing proof instead of deleting speculatively.

## Classify findings

### `P1`

Use for dead paths that actively create risk: stale flags masking security, billing, or data-integrity behavior, duplicate write paths that can diverge, or unreachable rollback logic that operators may believe still works.

### `P2`

Use for dead code in active boundaries: orphaned routes, handlers, jobs, or compatibility layers that increase maintenance cost or hide which path is truly live.

### `P3`

Use for routine cleanup: unused exports, unreachable local branches, dead helpers, unreferenced tests, or unused files with low behavioral risk.

### `P4`

Use for cosmetic leftovers: comments referencing removed flags, empty barrels, deprecated aliases with obvious replacements, or cleanup that does not materially affect maintenance risk.

## Auto-fix only when safe

Auto-fix local removals when proof is strong and the blast radius is contained.

Safe examples:

- remove statements after unconditional `return` or `throw`
- delete a private helper or local constant with zero references in one module
- remove an import/export pair that is unused and not part of a public surface
- collapse a stale flag branch when the live branch is unambiguous and locally verified
- delete an orphaned test helper or fixture with no references

Do not auto-fix without explicit approval when the change affects:

- public APIs, SDKs, or package exports
- framework conventions or auto-discovery
- dynamic loading or reflection
- remote feature-flag systems
- database migrations, backfills, or compliance artifacts
- shared build, CI, release, or deployment scripts
- cross-repo consumers you cannot verify locally

For those, report the finding and recommend the smallest removal plan.

## Choose the smallest defensible fix

Prefer this order:

1. Remove the dead leaf code.
2. Remove imports, exports, and registrations that only existed for it.
3. Remove stale tests or fixtures tied only to the deleted path.
4. Remove the flag or compatibility shim if both sides are now gone.
5. Stop once the live path is simpler and still verified.

Avoid broad "cleanup passes" that mix proven dead code with speculative simplification.

## Report findings in this format

List findings first, highest severity first.

For each finding, include:

- priority: `P1` to `P4`
- dead-code type: unused export, unreachable code, orphaned file, stale feature flag, dead registration, or compatibility layer
- location: file and line or the smallest concrete scope available
- proof chain: what references, registries, conventions, and validation checks were used
- false-positive risk: dynamic loading, external consumers, or unknowns
- recommended fix
- whether it is safe to auto-fix now

If no issues are found, say so explicitly and mention which entrypoints and dynamic-loading surfaces were checked plus any remaining blind spots.

## Default review stance

- Prefer proof over suspicion
- Prefer deletion over deprecation once reachability is disproven
- Prefer contained removals over broad cleanups
- Prefer preserving live entrypoints over chasing local neatness
- Prefer findings with concrete reference evidence over style commentary
