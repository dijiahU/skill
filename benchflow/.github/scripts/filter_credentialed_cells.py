"""Drop planned matrix cells whose agent+model credential is absent from the env.

The scope planner (``integration_matrix.py``) is PURE and deterministic: it emits
the full configured roster for a scope without consulting the live environment.
That is the right boundary for a planner, but it means a cell can be planned for
an agent whose required API key is not present in CI. Before this filter existed,
such a cell would spin up a Daytona sandbox, run the agent up to the first LLM
call, fail there, burn the sandbox, and leave the grader logging a *false-red*
slot that looks like a real regression.

This script is the SEPARATE env-aware step the workflow runs between ``plan`` and
``run-matrix``. For every cell it asks ``benchflow.agents.env.resolve_agent_env``
whether the agent+model can resolve a credential from the current process env. A
``ValueError`` whose message says a key is "required ... not set" means a missing
credential: the cell is DROPPED and recorded under ``skipped_uncredentialed`` with
the missing key name. Every other outcome (resolves cleanly, or raises for an
unrelated reason) KEEPS the cell — we only ever drop on a *documented* missing
credential, never on an ambiguous failure.

Fail-OPEN by design: if ``benchflow`` cannot be imported (e.g. the trusted base
during a bootstrap PR, where the package is not installed in the plan job), the
matrix passes through UNCHANGED and a warning is logged. The filter must never be
the thing that blocks a legitimate run.
