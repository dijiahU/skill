# Integration CI — admin setup (protected env, branch protection, secrets)

One-time GitHub configuration the L0–L3 integration workflows depend on. None of
this is enforceable from a workflow file; a repo admin must set it in the GitHub
UI / API. Workflows:

| Level | File | Trigger | Required? |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| L0 | `.github/workflows/test.yml` | push / PR / merge_group | yes (every PR) |
| L1 | `.github/workflows/integration-light.yml` | PR + dispatch + successful `test` run on `main` | yes (every PR; also gates previews) |
| L2 | `.github/workflows/integration-scope.yml` | PR (labeled `integration:medium`, …) + dispatch | yes (real work only on label) |
| L3 | `.github/workflows/integration-final-review.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` only | gated by protected env approval |

## 1. Branch protection (required status checks)

On the protected `main` branch, mark these checks **required**:

- `test` (L0 unit/lint/type lane)
- L1 job check from `integration-light` — the `detect-scope` + `rollout-smoke`
  jobs. Because `detect-scope` reports a **green no-op** (`should_run=false`)
  when a diff needs no rollout, this check can be required **unconditionally**
  without blocking docs-only PRs.
- L2 job check from `integration-scope` — likewise its `detect-scope` is a cheap
  green no-op when the `integration:medium` label is absent, so it is safe to
  require unconditionally.

> Required checks must **always run** (no `on: paths` filter) or a PR that
> doesn't touch the filtered paths would wait forever on a check that never
> starts. That is why every level's first job is the secret-free `detect-scope`
> no-op rather than a path filter.

L3 is **not** a required status check. It is enforced by the protected
environment approval below, plus the `integration-final-review` check-run that
the L3 review job publishes on the PR head SHA.

## 2. Protected environments

Use the existing **`pypi-internal-preview`** environment for L1/L2/L3 — **no
separate protected environment is created** (per the agreed simplification, L3's
golden truth is the HuggingFace leaderboard `main` runs vs the latest benchflow
main, not a human approval gate).

### `pypi-internal-preview` (L1 + L2 + L3)

- Holds the provider/Daytona/reviewer secrets (see §3).
- No required reviewers — L1/L2 run automatically on internal PRs; L3 is a manual
  `workflow_dispatch`.
- L1 attaches **only low-value** provider keys (DEEPSEEK / GEMINI /
  GITHUB_MODELS). L2/L3 attach **all** keys per the agreed Q6 residual. The L3
  codex reviewer authenticates with the **existing repo `OPENAI_API_KEY`** — no
  separate secret to create.
- *Optional, later:* to add a hard human gate, create a protected environment
  with required reviewers and point the L3 `run-matrix` / `review-pack` jobs at it.

## 3. Secrets

Set on each environment (not as bare repo secrets) so they rotate without
repo-admin Actions access. `*_BASE_URL` values are optional when the provider
has a built-in public endpoint; set one when routing through a custom gateway.

Provider (rollout + judge):
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `GLM_API_KEY`, `GLM_BASE_URL`,
`QWEN_API_KEY`, `QWEN_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`LITELLM_API_KEY` (or `BF_TOKEN`), `LITELLM_BASE_URL`, `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN`.

Per the agent model policy (see
[`../../docs/integration-tiers.md`](../../docs/integration-tiers.md) §3.3), these
specific keys are load-bearing:

- **`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — gates rollout AND grading; `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` is an
  optional override.** The 5 open agents (`openhands`, `openclaw`, `opencode`, `pi-acp`,
  `mimo`) run on `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` through the LiteLLM usage proxy; the
  provider defaults to DeepSeek's public OpenAI-compatible endpoint and honors
  `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` when set. The **agent-judge also runs on DeepSeek-v4 only**
  (`select_integration_provider.py` exports
  `BENCHFLOW_JUDGE_MODEL=openai/deepseek-v4-flash`, routed via the OpenAI-
  compatible surface with the DeepSeek key/base_url). The judge is NOT a matrix
  cell, so the credential filter does **not** protect it — a missing
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` fails grading on **every** cell.
- **`GEMINI_API_KEY` — set but NOT load-bearing.** Nothing on the default path
  consumes it: the judge runs on DeepSeek-v4 and the `gemini` /
  `harvey-lab-harness` rollout agents were dropped from the roster. It is
  provisioned on the environment as an available fallback only (the judge's
  failover order in `select_integration_provider.py` is DeepSeek → GLM → Qwen →
  LiteLLM → OpenAI → GitHub Models; gemini is not a judge candidate).
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** — `codex-acp` rollout model (`gpt-5.4-nano`) **and** the L3
  Codex equivalence reviewer. `codex-acp` is a GATED native (see below).
- **`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` (+ `AWS_REGION`) — `claude-agent-acp` credential,
  present in `pypi-internal-preview`.** `claude-agent-acp` routes through
  Bedrock's `anthropic-messages` surface
  (`aws-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`), which requires
  `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` and `AWS_REGION`
  (`src/benchflow/providers/litellm_config.py`). Both keys are set on the
  environment. If they are ever absent, credential-aware emission
  ([`../scripts/filter_credentialed_cells.py`](../scripts/filter_credentialed_cells.py))
  **drops** the `claude` cells as a documented skip (not a red slot).

> **Roster & gating (current policy).** The broad fan is **DeepSeek-only**: the 5
> DeepSeek agents (`openhands`, `pi-acp`, `openclaw`, `opencode`, `mimo`) run in
> every roster lane. The 2 **gated natives** — `claude-agent-acp` (Bedrock) and
> `codex-acp` (OpenAI) — cannot use DeepSeek and are blocked from the default
> fan; they run **only via affected-agent** (a PR touching their own adapter), so
> a default run needs only `DEEPSEEK_*` (rollout **and** judge) + `DAYTONA_API_KEY`.
> `gemini` and `harvey-lab-harness` were removed from the roster.

Sandbox: `DAYTONA_API_KEY` (L2/L3 only; L1 is docker-only).

Codex reviewer (L3, required): the **existing repo `OPENAI_API_KEY`** — durable
and revocable, unlike a personal ChatGPT OAuth blob. `codex_review.py` writes it
as an apikey `auth.json` at the codex config path (`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`,
default `~/.codex/auth.json`) before invoking `codex exec`. Auth precedence:
`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `CODEX_API_KEY`, then an optional `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` blob, then
a pre-existing on-host `auth.json`. If none resolve, L3 fails closed to
**`not mergeable (codex unavailable)`**.

## 4. Labels

- `integration:medium` — opens the L2 lane on a PR (its `detect-scope` only does
  real work when this label is present).
- `integration:deep` — signals an L2/L3-class change; L1's `rollout-smoke` steps
  aside when present so the lanes don't double-spend provider credits.

## 5. Security invariants (do not weaken)

- PR-facing workflows use plain `pull_request`, never `pull_request_target`, so
  forks receive no secrets. L1 also uses `workflow_run` after `test`, but its
  environment-backed job is fail-closed to a successful `push` on `main` and
  pins both trusted infrastructure and code-under-test to that tested SHA.
- `detect-scope`, `plan`, and `review-pack` check out the planner / grader /
  harness / review skill from **trusted `origin/main`** (sparse), never the PR
  head. Only `src/benchflow` (the orchestrator code-under-test) is overlaid from
  the PR head SHA.
- The L3 final verdict is `worst(deterministic, codex)`: codex can only make the
  verdict stricter, never upgrade a deterministic `not mergeable`.
- Actions are SHA-pinned. `actions/download-artifact`
  (`d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093`, v4.3.0) and
  `actions/github-script` (`60a0d83039c74a4aee543508d2ffcb1c3799cdea`, v7.0.1)
  are new surface relative to L0/L1's existing pins — re-verify on bump.
