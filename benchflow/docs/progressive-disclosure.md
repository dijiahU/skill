# Progressive disclosure
## TL;DR

`BaseUser` is a Python callback that drives a benchflow rollout across multiple rounds. Each round: the callback sees the previous verifier result and decides what to tell the agent next, or stops the loop. No second LLM, no outbox protocol — just a function that knows how to grade and hint.

It was built for the SWE-bench Pro progressive-disclosure use case: the dataset's instructions are long structured specs that overwhelm agents in a single turn. A `BaseUser` lets you compress the spec for round 0, watch which tests fail, then disclose hints from the spec on subsequent rounds — all driven by deterministic Python, not by another LLM acting as a "user."

Other agent-eval frameworks model this with a "simulated user" — a second LLM running in a sidecar container that talks to the agent over a side channel. benchflow's `BaseUser` is just in-process Python: no second LLM, no sidecar, no outbox protocol.

```python
import benchflow as bf
from benchflow import FunctionUser, RoundResult
from benchflow.rollout import RolloutConfig, Scene
from benchflow._utils.benchmark_repos import resolve_source


def progressive(round: int, instruction: str, rr: RoundResult | None) -> str | None:
    if round == 0:
        return instruction.split("\n")[0]                # terse: first line only
    if rr and (rr.rewards or {}).get("reward", 0) >= 1.0:
        return None                                      # passed, stop
    if round >= 3:
        return None                                      # cap at 3 rounds
    return (
        f"Tests failed:\n{rr.verifier_output}\n\n"       # show failures + spec
        f"Full spec:\n{instruction}"
    )


config = RolloutConfig(
    task_path=resolve_source("benchflow-ai/swebenchpro", path="instance_flipt-io__flipt-..."),
    scenes=[Scene.single(agent="opencode", model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6")],
    user=FunctionUser(progressive),
    max_user_rounds=3,
    environment="daytona",
)
result = await bf.run(config)
```

## Case study: SWE-bench Pro

SWE-bench Pro tasks ship long, structured `instruction.md` specs (typically 2-5KB) describing API requirements, test fixtures, and expected behaviors. Single-shot agents either drown in the spec or under-engineer because they bail before reading to the bottom.

The SWE-bench Pro eval that motivated this feature wanted exactly this loop:

```
round 0   "Fix the bug described here: <one-line summary>"
            agent attempts → tests fail
round 1   "Tests <names> failed. Here is the full requirements section: <half of spec>."
            agent retries → tests still fail
round 2   "Still failing. Here's the full original spec: <complete instruction>"
            agent makes final attempt
```

Rule-based, deterministic, and the "user" never needs to think — the disclosure schedule is fixed. Spinning up a second LLM to play the user role would (a) cost double, (b) introduce nondeterminism, and (c) require an outbox protocol the agent has to learn.

### Validation (2026-04-25, 5 SWE-bench Pro tasks, Daytona, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview)

| Task | Oracle | Single-round baseline | 3-round progressive (final) | Per-round soft-verify |
|------|--------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| ansible | ✅ 1.0 | ✅ 1.0 (23 tools, 207s) | ✅ 1.0 (126 tools, 3 rounds) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |
| flipt | ✅ 1.0 | ❌ 0.0 (61 tools, 1444s) | ❌ 0.0 (195 tools, 3 rounds) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |
| openlibrary | ✅ 1.0 | ✅ 1.0 (32 tools, 340s) | ✅ 1.0 (82 tools, 3 rounds) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |
| navidrome | ✅ 1.0 | (not tested) | ❌ 0.0 (145 tools, 3 rounds) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |
| qutebrowser | ✅ 1.0 (with `cleanup_conftests=false`) | ❌ 0.0 (verifier broken pre-fix) | ✅ 1.0 (183 tools, 3 rounds) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |

What this run shows and doesn't show:

- **The infrastructure works on real SWE-bench Pro tasks.** All 5 tasks completed 3 rounds end-to-end (after one retry on ansible/qutebrowser to clear intermittent flake). Round trajectories captured, soft_verify runs between rounds, BaseUser callback drives the loop.
- **3/5 hit the canonical reward** (ansible, openlibrary, qutebrowser). flipt and navidrome stayed at 0.0 across all three rounds — Gemini 3.1 Pro doesn't crack them with this hint schedule, and progressive disclosure didn't help.
- **Per-round soft-verify scored 0.0 even on tasks where the final hardened verify scored 1.0.** Soft-verify runs between rounds without the full hardening sequence (no workspace restore, no process kill so the sandbox stays alive), so its scoring can diverge from the final verifier. The user's hint schedule reacts to soft-verify, not the canonical reward — something to keep in mind when designing the loop.
- **First-run flake.** ansible's first run hit a transport EOF after 17min and qutebrowser timed out at 50min. Both succeeded on retry. v0.3.3 adds `agent_idle_timeout` (default 600s) and clearer EOF diagnostics so the next time a hang happens the failure is fast and actionable rather than silent.

This is one model on one day, not a published comparison. The notebook at [`examples/swebench_pro_progressive_disclosure.ipynb`](./examples/swebench_pro_progressive_disclosure.ipynb) has the executable cells.

## Where it lives in the rollout lifecycle

`BaseUser` plugs into the existing `Rollout` lifecycle ([concepts](./concepts.md#rollout-lifecycle)) without changing any of the existing phases. When `RolloutConfig.user` is set, `Rollout._run_user_loop()` replaces the single-pass `connect → execute → disconnect` block with a per-round version:

```
setup() → start() → install_agent()
    ↓
[oracle setup if oracle_access=True: read /solution, hide it from agent]
    ↓
user.setup(instruction, solution)        ← once
    ↓
┌─ user.run(round, instruction, rr) → str | None
│      │ None: break
│      ↓
│   connect_as(role)
│   execute(prompts=[prompt])
│   disconnect()
│      ↓
│   soft_verify()                         ← partial hardening, sandbox stays alive
│      ↓
│   build RoundResult, log, repeat
└─    │
      ↓ (loop ends when user returns None or max_user_rounds reached)
[oracle restore: mv /solution_oracle_backup → /solution for final verify]
    ↓
verify()                                  ← full hardening, final reward
    ↓
cleanup()
```

Multi-scene / multi-role configs are not compatible with `User` — the loop assumes one Scene with one Role. Setting both raises `ValueError`.

## Soft-verify and full-verify: two different verifiers

Between rounds, BenchFlow needs to score the agent's progress so the user can react. But the final, end-of-rollout verifier does destructive things (kills the agent, restores the workspace, chowns to root) that would prevent the next round from running. So BenchFlow executes **two** verifier passes:

| | Soft-verify (between rounds) | Full-verify (end of rollout) |
|---|---|---|
| Kills agent processes | ❌ no | ✅ yes |
| Restores workspace from snapshot | ❌ no | ✅ optional, task-driven |
| Purges agent-injected `conftest.py`, `sitecustomize.py`, `.pth` | ✅ yes | ✅ yes |
| Locks down PATH/PYTHONPATH | ✅ yes | ✅ yes |
| `chmod 777 /logs/verifier` | ✅ yes (so non-root verifier can write) | n/a (root) |
| Runs verifier | ✅ yes | ✅ yes |
| Result | feeds `RoundResult.rewards` | the rollout's final score |

Soft-verify is intentionally weaker than full-verify — losing some score-gaming protection in exchange for keeping the sandbox alive. The cleanup step still purges agent-injected hook files (`CLEANUP_CMD`), so an agent can't plant a `conftest.py` that flips the round score.

## API

### `BaseUser`

```python
from benchflow import BaseUser, RoundResult


class MyUser(BaseUser):
    async def setup(self, instruction: str, solution: str | None = None) -> None:
        """Called once before round 0.

        instruction — the original task instruction (from instruction.md)
        solution    — gold answer if oracle_access=True, else None
        """
        self.spec = instruction
        self.gold = solution

    async def run(
        self,
        round: int,
        instruction: str,
        round_result: RoundResult | None = None,
    ) -> str | None:
        """Return the next prompt, or None to stop.

        round — 0-indexed
        instruction — original task instruction (unchanged each round)
        round_result — None on round 0; previous round's outcome on subsequent rounds
        """
        ...
```

### `RoundResult`

Dataclass passed to `run()` from round 1 onward.

```python
@dataclass
class RoundResult:
    round: int                     # 0-indexed
    trajectory: list[dict]         # ACP events from this round only
    rewards: dict | None           # verifier rewards (None if verifier crashed)
    verifier_output: str | None    # raw verifier stdout/log
    verifier_error: str | None     # exception message if verifier failed
    n_tool_calls: int              # tool calls in this round
```

### `PassthroughUser`

Sends the instruction unchanged on round 0, stops on round 1. Use it as the explicit single-round-equivalent.

### `FunctionUser`

Wraps a plain function as a `BaseUser`. Sync or async — uses `inspect.isawaitable` to detect.

```python
def fn(round, instruction, rr): ...
user = FunctionUser(fn)

async def afn(round, instruction, rr): ...
user = FunctionUser(afn)
```

### `RolloutConfig` fields

```python
user: BaseUser | None = None     # the callback
max_user_rounds: int = 5         # cap on rounds (loop also stops when user returns None)
oracle_access: bool = False      # expose gold solution to user.setup()
```

---

## Oracle access

When `oracle_access=True`:

1. Before round 0, the rollout reads `/solution/solve.sh` and passes its contents to `user.setup(instruction, solution=...)`.
2. The rollout moves `/solution` → `/solution_oracle_backup` so the agent can't read it during its rounds.
3. Between rounds, soft-verify temporarily restores `/solution` (some verifiers consult it) then re-hides it.
4. Before the final `verify()`, the rollout permanently restores `/solution`.

Step 4 is wrapped in `try/finally` against the user loop: if a round throws, the restore still runs.

> ⚠️ Setting `oracle_access=True` *without* a `User` is a misconfiguration — the solution stays exposed to the agent for the entire rollout. benchflow logs a `WARNING` at setup time when this happens.

Use cases for oracle access:
- **Dataset generation** — the user has the answer, generates an optimal prompt for the agent
- **Curriculum learning** — progressively reveal pieces of the solution
- **Research** — measure how much oracle information is required for an agent to succeed

## Per-task hardening opt-outs

The verifier's pre-run cleanup deletes `conftest.py` outside `/tests/` to prevent reward-hacking. Some tasks (qutebrowser) ship legitimate `conftest.py` files that fix real circular imports — deleting them breaks pytest collection.

Tasks opt out in `task.toml`:

```toml
[verifier.hardening]
cleanup_conftests = false
```

| Flag | Default | Effect when `false` |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `cleanup_conftests` | `true` | Don't delete `conftest.py` outside `/tests/` before verify |

`sitecustomize.py`, `.pth` files, and `*.py` in `/tmp` always get cleaned — they have no legitimate use in a test artifact and disabling them broadens the attack surface beyond what real-world tasks need.

Unknown keys in `[verifier.hardening]` are warned and ignored. String values for boolean flags are rejected.

---

## Failure modes

The user loop catches exceptions from `user.run()` and stops, with the exception message stored in `Rollout._error`:

```
[User] round 2: prompt='Try again, focusing on...'
ERROR  user.run() failed at round 2: KeyError: 'spec_section'
```

`soft_verify()` between rounds catches its own timeouts and crashes — they surface as `RoundResult.verifier_error`, not as a rollout-level failure. The next round still runs and the user can decide what to do.

Trajectory and tool counts are sliced per round from `Rollout._trajectory`. The session counters reset on `disconnect()`, so each round's `RoundResult.trajectory` and `n_tool_calls` reflect only that round's events, not cumulative.

---

## Comparison with multi-agent simulated user

benchflow has two patterns for multi-round agent runs. Neither requires a sidecar container.

| Pattern | What "user" is | When to use |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **`BaseUser` callback (this doc)** | Python function in the scheduler process | Programmatic, deterministic, rule-based. No second LLM. Cheap. Best for progressive disclosure, curriculum, scripted hints. |
| **Multi-role Scene with simulated-user role** ([use-cases §1](./use-cases.md#1-interactive-user-simulation)) | Another LLM with full tool access | Open-ended, conversational. The "user" can read files, check outputs, give nuanced feedback. Best when the user's behavior must itself be adaptive or LLM-quality. |

The two coexist. Choose based on whether your "user" needs to think (Scene-based) or just decide (`BaseUser`). For the SWE-bench Pro use case, the disclosure schedule is fixed, the grading is the verifier, and there's nothing for a second LLM to add — `BaseUser` wins on cost and determinism.
