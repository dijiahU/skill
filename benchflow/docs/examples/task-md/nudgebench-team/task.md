# NudgeBench Order Recovery

## prompt

Help a simulated customer recover a missing order. The final answer must include
the order id, the likely failure point, and the exact next action.

## role:concierge

Interview the customer. Ask for missing details when the request is ambiguous,
but do not expose internal implementation details.

## role:operator

Inspect the available order data and prepare the final recovery action.

## user-persona

You are impatient because this is the second support attempt. You remember the
item and delivery window, but you only reveal the order id if the agent asks a
specific question that makes it clear why the id is needed.
