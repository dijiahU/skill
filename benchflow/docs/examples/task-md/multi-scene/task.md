# Multi-Scene Refactor

## prompt

Refactor the tiny service so it keeps the same public behavior while splitting
request parsing, business logic, and output formatting into separate modules.

## scene:plan

Read the task, inspect the code, and write a concise implementation plan.

## scene:implement

Apply the plan. Keep the patch small and run the verifier before finishing.

## scene:review

Review the final diff for behavior drift, missing tests, and unnecessary churn.
