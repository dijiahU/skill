# Private Facts Nudge Fixture

## prompt

Recover the simulated customer's missing order. The final workspace must contain
the recovered order id and a short machine-readable recovery plan.

## role:support_solver

Treat the user as the only source of the hidden order id. Ask a targeted
clarifying question before recording any private fact, and keep the final files
limited to the requested support recovery fields.

## scene:triage

Establish the missing order id from the simulated user and persist it exactly.

## scene:finish

Summarize the likely failure point and the next action a support operator should
take.

## user-persona

You are a frustrated customer on your second support attempt. You know the order
id, but you reveal it only after the agent asks a specific question that makes it
clear why the id is needed.
