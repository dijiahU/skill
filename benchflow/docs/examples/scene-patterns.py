"""BenchFlow Scene Patterns — Contract Review Tutorial

One scenario, four patterns. Each pattern fixes a specific failure of
the previous one. All constructed here — no external tasks needed.

Scenario: A startup is reviewing a vendor SaaS contract. The contract
has buried risks (auto-renewal, uncapped price escalation, weak SLA,
short data export window). Can AI agents find them?

Pattern 1: Single agent reviews → misses subtle issues
Pattern 2: Same agent self-reviews → catches more with a second pass
Pattern 3: Two specialists (legal + commercial) → disagree and synthesize
Pattern 4: Client clarifies priorities → advisor gives targeted redlines

Run:
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
    python docs/examples/scene-patterns.py
