# Authoring native task.md tasks

A native BenchFlow task is one `task.md` document plus sidecar directories.
The YAML frontmatter carries the task configuration; the markdown body **is**
the prompt. This page teaches the native format hands-on. For the normative
standard see [the task standard](./task-standard.md).

When a directory contains both layouts, `task.md` is the authoritative task
definition — the runtime selects it and ignores the split pair.

---

## Minimal task — three files

```text
my-task/
├── task.md                # config frontmatter + prompt body
├── environment/
│   └── Dockerfile         # sandbox image
└── verifier/
    └── test.sh            # verifier entry point
```

That is the complete runnable surface: structural validation requires
`task.md`, an `environment/` directory with a `Dockerfile`, and a verifier
directory with a runnable entrypoint. An `oracle/` directory is optional.

```markdown
---
agent:
  timeout_sec: 300         # strongly recommended — unset means no wall-clock cap
verifier:
  timeout_sec: 120
sandbox:
  cpus: 1
  memory_mb: 2048
---

Create a file `/app/hello.txt` containing exactly `Hello, world!`.
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verifier/test.sh
REWARD=0
if [ "$(cat /app/hello.txt 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\n')" = "Hello, world!" ]; then
    REWARD=1
fi
echo "$REWARD" > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
```

Scaffold this shape with the CLI (task.md is the default format):

```bash
bench tasks init my-task                    # task.md, environment/, verifier/, oracle/
bench tasks check tasks/my-task             # structural validation
bench tasks check tasks/my-task --level schema   # frontmatter + prompt parse only
```

---

## Frontmatter

`task.md` must start with a `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter block, and the
frontmatter must be a mapping — a document without it fails to parse. The keys
fall into three classes.

**Task config keys** are the BenchFlow task config surface, validated as
`TaskConfig`. Unknown keys are **rejected** (the schema is `extra="forbid"`),
so typos fail at parse time instead of becoming silently-ignored config:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` (alias `version`) | Config schema version, currently `"1.3"` |
| `task` | Package identity: `name` (`org/name` format), `description`, `authors`, `keywords`, `version` (informational Harbor 1.3 field, stored verbatim) |
| `metadata` | Freeform mapping — difficulty, category, tags, anything descriptive |
| `agent` | Agent run policy: `timeout_sec`, `user`, `network_mode`, `allowed_hosts` |
| `verifier` | Verifier run policy: `timeout_sec` (default 600), `env`, `user`, `service`, … |
| `sandbox` | Sandbox: `docker_image`, `cpus`, `memory_mb`, `storage_mb`, `network_mode`, `env`, `workdir`, … (legacy `task.toml` imports convert the Harbor `environment` table to this key; `environment:` in `task.md` is rejected with a rename hint) |
| `oracle` | Oracle run policy: `env`, `timeout_sec` (import alias: `solution`) |
| `source`, `artifacts`, `steps`, `multi_step_reward_strategy`, `reward` | Provenance, artifact, and reward metadata |

`agent.timeout_sec` is **strongly recommended**: it is optional and defaults
to unset, and a task that omits it runs the agent with no wall-clock cap
unless the caller supplies a per-run timeout. Set it on every published task.

Declaring both `oracle` and the legacy `solution` alias in one config is
invalid and rejected; native tasks use `oracle`.

**Document orchestration keys** are parsed by `TaskDocument`, not `TaskConfig`:
`agents` (named roles with `agent`, `model`, `reasoning_effort`,
`capabilities`, …), `scenes` (ordered turns referencing declared roles — a
turn that names an undeclared role is a parse error), and `user` (simulated
user). `benchflow` is the reserved extension namespace.

**Authoring shorthands** are expanded during parsing and never reach the
canonical config under their short names:

| Shorthand | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `name: hello-world` | `task.name: benchflow/hello-world` (a `/` in the value keeps your org) |
| `image: ubuntu:24.04` | `sandbox.docker_image: ubuntu:24.04` |
| `verifier: verifier/` (string form) | `benchflow.verifier.path` / `.spec` / `.entrypoint` defaults |
| `oracle: oracle/` (string form) | `benchflow.oracle.path` |
| `profile: code-change` | Merges a named defaults bundle (see below) |

Profiles (`profile:` / `profiles:`) merge predefined default bundles —
`code-change`, `harbor-compatible`, `reward-kit`, `acceptance-live`,
`multi-agent`, `leaderboard-local` — under your explicit keys; an unknown
profile name is a parse error. `bench tasks normalize <task-dir>` prints the
fully expanded canonical document (`--write` replaces `task.md` in place), so
a minimal authored file and its canonical form never drift apart.

---

## Prompt body and prompts/ sidecars

The body below the frontmatter is the base prompt — free-form markdown, no
heading ceremony required. If the body contains no reserved section headings,
the entire body is the instruction the agent receives.

Four reserved headings are recognized for compatibility imports: `## prompt`,
`## role:<name>`, `## scene:<name>`, and `## user-persona`. Repeating the same
section heading is a parse error. `bench tasks init` scaffolds a single
`## prompt` section as a starting point — for a single-prompt task that is
equivalent to a bare body, so keep it or drop the heading as you prefer. The
multi-prompt headings (`## role:`, `## scene:`, `## user-persona`) are for
compatibility imports only; new multi-prompt material belongs in sidecar files
under `prompts/`:

| File | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prompts/role.<name>.md` | Role prompt — the whole file body is the prompt text |
| `prompts/scene.<name>.md` | Scene prompt |
| `prompts/user-persona.md` | Simulated-user persona |

Sidecar files take precedence over a reserved heading of the same name, so a
compat-imported task can be cleaned up incrementally. Runtime prompt
precedence for a turn is: inline turn prompt, then scene prompt, then role
prompt, then base prompt.

A multi-role task wires the pieces together in frontmatter:

```yaml
agents:
  roles:
    solver:
      agent: claude-agent-acp
scenes:
  - name: solve
    turns:
      - role: solver
```

with the solver guidance, if any, in `prompts/role.solver.md`. See
[docs/examples/task-md/](./examples/task-md/README.md) for runnable examples,
including real converted SkillsBench packages.

## Verifier package and strategy declaration

The native verifier directory is `verifier/`. At verify time the directory is
uploaded into the sandbox at `/verifier`, and the verifier must write its
reward to `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` (and optionally
`/logs/verifier/reward.json`).

A plain `verifier/test.sh` is a complete verifier: with no other declaration,
the runtime executes it directly. Write a float `0.0`–`1.0` to
`/logs/verifier/reward.txt`, then exit `0`; a nonzero exit means verifier
infrastructure failure, not a scored task failure.

To declare *how* the task is scored, add `verifier/verifier.md`. Its
frontmatter must contain a `verifier:` mapping with at least one entry under
`strategies`; `default_strategy` selects which one runs (it defaults to the
first declared strategy and must name a declared one):

```markdown
---
document_version: "0.3"
verifier:
  name: my-task-verifier
  default_strategy: deterministic
  strategies:
    deterministic:
      type: script
      command: ./test.sh
  outputs:
    reward_text: /logs/verifier/reward.txt
    reward_json: /logs/verifier/reward.json
---

## verifier intent

What the verifier measures and which task outputs it reads.
```

Five strategy types are recognized, each with fail-closed required fields:

| `type` | Required config | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `script` | `command` | Runs as `cd /verifier && <command>`; local script files named in the command must exist in `verifier/` |
| `llm-judge` | `rubric` | Optional `model`, `input_dir`, and `context` *or* `context_file` (not both) |
| `reward-kit` | `root` | Optional `entrypoint` (default `reward.py`) and `criteria`; paths must be safe-relative |
| `agent-judge` | `role`, `isolation: verifier-only`, `inputs` | `role` must match a `## role:<name>` section in the verifier.md body |
| `ors-episode` | `inputs` | Optional `format`: `json`, `jsonl`, or `auto` |

An unknown `type` is a parse error. `bench tasks check` also verifies the
selected strategy is actually runnable — e.g. a `script` strategy whose
referenced files are missing, or an `llm-judge` strategy whose rubric file
does not exist, fails validation.

`outputs` declares the reward artifact contract (defaults shown above;
`details_json` and `aggregate_policy` are optional). `bench tasks check
--level publication-grade` additionally requires the native package shape:
`task.md`, native `oracle/`, `verifier/verifier.md` with rubric files, and an
explicit `reward_json` output contract.

---

## Oracle

`oracle/solve.sh` is the held-out reference solution (`solution/` is the
legacy alias; `oracle/` wins when both exist). Native oracles are uploaded to
`/oracle` in the sandbox (legacy `solution/` to `/solution`) and run instead
of an agent with `--agent oracle`:

```bash
bench eval run --tasks-dir tasks/my-task --agent oracle --sandbox docker
```

A correct task scores `1.0` on its oracle run before any model sees it.

---

## Multi-container tasks

A task may ship an `environment/docker-compose.yaml` alongside the
`Dockerfile`. The agent always runs in the `main` service; any additional
services you declare become sibling containers on the same Docker network.
This supports vulhub-style CVE tasks where the agent attacks a separate target
container over the network.

> `environment/Dockerfile` is always required — `bench tasks check` rejects a
> task that ships only a `docker-compose.yaml`. If your `main` service uses a
> prebuilt `image:` and needs no build context, still include a minimal
> `Dockerfile` (e.g. `FROM <same-image>`) so structural validation and other
> tooling agree on the task package shape.

```yaml
# environment/docker-compose.yaml
services:
  main: {}            # agent container — BenchFlow injects build/image/limits
  target:             # vulnerable service the agent must exploit
    image: vulhub/struts2-s2-001:latest
    expose: ["8080"]
```

`main` reaches `target` by service name (`http://target:8080`). The verifier
can inspect *target-side* state — not just the agent's workspace — by passing a
`service` argument when running commands:

```python
# In a Python-driven run or pre/post hook
await env.exec_in_service("target", "test -f /tmp/exploit_proof.txt")
await env.exec("cat /flag", service="target")          # equivalent form
services = await env.inner.services()                  # ["main", "target"]
```

`exec(..., service=...)` works on the Docker sandbox and the Daytona DinD
(compose) sandbox. Single-container backends (Modal, direct Daytona) raise a
clear error for any non-`main` service. This lets a verifier check write-based
oracles (`/tmp/exploit.txt` in the target), database modifications, or RCE
markers without trusting the agent container.

### Target-side verifier with `verifier.service`

For tasks whose success oracle lives in a target container — an RCE marker
file, a modified database row — point the `verifier/test.sh` verifier at that
service with the `service` key under `verifier` in the frontmatter:

```yaml
verifier:
  service: target     # run verifier/test.sh inside the `target` container
```

With this set, BenchFlow uploads the task's `verifier/` directory into the
**target** container, runs `test.sh` there, and copies the resulting
`reward.txt` / `reward.json` back to the host. `service` defaults to `"main"`
(the agent container), so single-container tasks are unaffected.

`verifier.service` is the declarative, task-schema way to do cross-container
verification; the `env.exec_in_service(...)` Python API above is the imperative
equivalent for hook-driven runs.

> Use the same `service` name you declared in `docker-compose.yaml`. A
> `test.sh` running in the target reaches `main` (and vice versa) by service
> name over the Docker network, just like the agent does.

### Hardening policy for multi-container tasks

BenchFlow's pre-verification hardening — killing the sandbox user's processes,
scrubbing `PATH`/`PYTHONPATH`, restoring build-config files — applies **only to
the `main` (agent) container**. Target containers are deliberately left
unhardened: a vulhub-style target is *meant* to be vulnerable, the agent never
has a shell inside it, and hardening it would risk breaking the very
vulnerability the task exercises. `verifier.service` selects where `test.sh`
*runs*; it does not move hardening off `main`.

## Migrating a legacy task

`bench tasks migrate` converts a `task.toml` + `instruction.md` pair into
`task.md`:

```bash
bench tasks migrate tasks/my-task                  # writes task.md, keeps legacy files
bench tasks migrate tasks/my-task --overwrite      # replace an existing task.md
bench tasks migrate tasks/my-task --remove-legacy  # delete the split pair and
                                                   # promote tests/ -> verifier/,
                                                   # solution/ -> oracle/
```

The migration is non-destructive by default and refuses to write anything
lossy: the generated document is re-parsed and must reproduce the original
config semantics and instruction text exactly, or the command fails. Unknown
`task.toml` keys that the schema does not model are preserved under
`benchflow.compat` in the generated frontmatter rather than dropped. After
migrating, validate the result:

```bash
bench tasks check tasks/my-task
bench eval run --tasks-dir tasks/my-task --agent oracle --sandbox docker
```

## Compatibility Export

To produce a compatibility split package from a `task.md` package, use
`bench tasks export`:

```bash
bench tasks export tasks/my-task out/my-task-split
bench tasks export tasks/my-task --report-only                # loss report only
```

The export writes a compatibility loss report to
`compatibility/export-report.json` so you can see what (if anything) the
split layout cannot represent. Publication-grade validation requires
`task.md` to be the only authoritative entrypoint, so keep exported split
layouts in a separate output directory rather than beside `task.md`. See
[CLI reference: bench tasks export](./reference/cli.md#bench-tasks-export)
for all flags.
