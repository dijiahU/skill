# Running Adapted Benchmarks

How to run benchmarks that have been converted into Harbor-format tasks for BenchFlow.

BenchFlow ships with adapted benchmarks under `benchmarks/<name>/`. Each benchmark
includes a converter, parity tests, metadata, and one or more YAML job configs.
This guide covers how to run them — from a single task to a full evaluation sweep.

> [!NOTE]
> BenchFlow is providing first-party support for PrimeIntellect Verifiers and OpenReward Standard.

> **Working inside the benchflow repo?** Use `uv run bench` instead of `bench`
> to run the CLI from your local editable install.

## Available benchmarks

| Benchmark | Tasks | Verification | Config |
|-----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| [Harvey LAB](https://github.com/harveyai/harvey-labs) | 1,251 | LLM-as-judge (per-criterion) | `benchmarks/harvey-lab/` |
| [ProgramBench](https://programbench.com) | 201 | Deterministic unit tests | `benchmarks/programbench/` |
| [SkillsBench](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/skillsbench) | 94+ | Unit tests | `--source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench --source-path tasks` |

Each adapted benchmark includes:
- **`benchflow.py`** — converter for the raw benchmark source
- **`benchmark.yaml`** — metadata descriptor (task count, categories, verification method, parity results)
- **`<name>-*.yaml`** — job configs for different agents/models
- **`parity_test.py`** — parity validation suite
- **`parity_experiment.json`** — recorded parity results

### Environment-plane benchmarks

Stateful, multi-service benchmarks integrate differently: instead of a
converter they ship an `environment.toml` **manifest** and run on the
[Environment plane](./environment-plane.md). Two are onboarded:

| Benchmark | Topology | Manifest |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **ClawsBench** | mock Gmail/Slack/Calendar/Docs/Drive, framework-started | `benchmarks/clawsbench/environment.toml` |
| **chi-bench** | ~25k-LOC healthcare simulator, image-owned lifecycle | `benchmarks/chi-bench/environment.toml` |

See [Running a benchmark with an Environment manifest](#running-a-benchmark-with-an-environment-manifest) below.

---

## Quick start

### Option 1: YAML config (`bench eval run --config`)

The simplest path. Point at a YAML config that specifies the benchmark source,
agent, and model:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=... bench eval run --config benchmarks/harvey-lab/harvey-lab-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
GEMINI_API_KEY=... bench eval run --config benchmarks/programbench/programbench-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
bench eval run --config benchmarks/harvey-lab/harvey-lab-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
```

The config handles everything — downloads/generates tasks, resolves the task path,
and runs the evaluation.

### Option 2: CLI flags

Use CLI flags for ad-hoc runs without a config file:

```bash
# Harvey LAB — single pre-converted task
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/benchmarks \
  --source-path datasets/harvey-lab/tasks/corporate-ma-analyze-cim-deal-teaser-scenario-01 \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker

# Harvey LAB harness adapter smoke test.
# Requires GEMINI_API_KEY for the agent and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for the verifier.
uv run bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/benchmarks \
  --source-path datasets/harvey-lab/tasks/corporate-ma-analyze-cim-deal-teaser-scenario-01 \
  --agent harvey-lab-harness \
  --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview \
  --sandbox docker \
  --concurrency 1 \
  --jobs-dir jobs/smoke-test/harvey-harness

# Harvey LAB — all pre-converted tasks
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/benchmarks \
  --source-path datasets/harvey-lab/tasks \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker --concurrency 4

# SkillsBench
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench \
  --source-path tasks/edit-pdf \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview

# ProgramBench — single task (tasks are generated at runtime by the converter;
# see "Running ProgramBench" below for the generation step)
bench eval run \
  --tasks-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks/abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6 \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker

# Claude Code on Daytona
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench \
  --source-path tasks \
  --agent claude-agent-acp --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 --sandbox daytona --concurrency 32
```

> **Note:** Harvey LAB task names in `benchflow-ai/benchmarks` are flattened with
> hyphens (e.g. `corporate-ma-analyze-cim-deal-teaser-scenario-01`), not nested
> paths like the original repo (`corporate-ma/analyze-cim-deal-teaser/scenario-01`).

### Option 3: Python API

For programmatic use, custom pipelines, or integration with other tools:

```python
import asyncio
from benchflow.evaluation import Evaluation

async def main():
    job = Evaluation.from_yaml("benchmarks/harvey-lab/harvey-lab-gemini-flash-lite.yaml")
    result = await job.run()
    print(f"Score: {result.passed}/{result.total} ({result.score:.1%})")

asyncio.run(main())
```

For single-task runs:

```python
import benchflow as bf
from benchflow import RolloutConfig, Scene
from benchflow._utils.benchmark_repos import resolve_source

task_path = resolve_source("benchflow-ai/skillsbench", path="tasks/edit-pdf")

config = RolloutConfig(
    task_path=task_path,
    scenes=[Scene.single(agent="gemini", model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview")],
    environment="docker",
)
result = await bf.run(config)
print(result.rewards)
```

---

## Versioned dataset runs (`--dataset`)

For runs whose results should be attributable to a published, immutable
dataset version (leaderboards, papers, release evidence), resolve the task
set from a dataset registry instead of pointing at a directory or branch:

```bash
# Resolve skillsbench@1.1 from the registry, verify every task's content
# digest against the pinned snapshot, then run.
bench eval run -d skillsbench@1.1 \
  --agent claude-agent-acp --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001

# Versions are immutable, so the version is always explicit — there is no
# floating "latest". --include/--exclude filter the registry roster.
bench eval run -d skillsbench@1.1 --include xlsx-recover-data ...
```

A registry (`registry.json` at a dataset repo's root — see skillsbench's
[`docs/dataset-versioning.md`](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/skillsbench/blob/main/docs/dataset-versioning.md))
pins each dataset version to an exact `git_commit_id` and per-task sha256
content digests. Resolution clones the pinned commit into
`.cache/datasets`, materializes an immutable per-commit snapshot,
recomputes every task's digest, and **fails before running anything** on
any mismatch. Snapshot directories that are not part of the registry entry
are excluded from the run. The entry's `bench_version` range is a hard
gate: running on a benchflow outside the range the dataset was validated
against fails before anything runs, because the results may not be
comparable with published runs. `--ignore-bench-version` overrides the
gate for local experimentation — the run then proceeds with a visible
warning on the record.

The registry is fetched from the skillsbench repo by default; point
`--registry` at another URL or a local `registry.json` to override.

Every `result.json`/`config.json` is stamped with `dataset_name`,
`dataset_version`, and the per-task `task_digest` (`summary.json` carries
the name/version), so downstream tooling can group results by
`dataset@version`. `--tasks-dir` stays as the visibly distinct dev mode:
its artifacts carry no dataset fields — but they still stamp a
live-computed `task_digest`, so even dev trajectories remain attributable
to exact task content. `bench tasks digest <task-dir>` prints the same
digest for any task directory.

## Running a subset of tasks

### Single task

```bash
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench \
  --source-path tasks/edit-pdf \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview

bench eval run \
  --tasks-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks/abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6 \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker

bench eval run \
  --tasks-dir .cache/harvey-lab-tasks/corporate-ma-review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker
```

### Batch with a tasks directory

Point `bench eval run --tasks-dir` at a directory containing only the tasks you want:

```bash
bench eval run --tasks-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker --concurrency 4
```

### Using `--source-path` for remote subsets

```bash
# SkillsBench single task
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench \
  --source-path tasks/edit-pdf \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker

# Harvey LAB single task (pre-converted)
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/benchmarks \
  --source-path datasets/harvey-lab/tasks/corporate-ma-analyze-cim-deal-teaser-scenario-01 \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker
```

## Running ProgramBench

201 program-reconstruction tasks across 7 languages (C, Rust, Go, C++, Java, Haskell, Bash).
Tasks are **generated** at runtime from the ProgramBench repo's metadata —
`benchmarks/programbench/tasks/` is not checked into this repo and must be
produced first.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (images are linux/amd64 only — use a Linux x86_64 machine)
- ~20GB disk for Docker images
- Internet access for HuggingFace test blob downloads during verification
- A local clone of [`programbench`](https://programbench.com) (passed via
  `--programbench-dir` to the generator)

### Generate the tasks

```bash
# All 200 tasks
python -m benchmarks.programbench.main \
    --programbench-dir ~/programbench \
    --output-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks

# Or a single task
python -m benchmarks.programbench.main \
    --programbench-dir ~/programbench \
    --output-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks \
    --task-ids abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6
```

### Run all tasks

```bash
bench eval run --config benchmarks/programbench/programbench-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
```

### Run a single task (after generation)

```bash
bench eval run \
  --tasks-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks/abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6 \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox docker
```

### Oracle verification

Verify a task is solvable using the gold solution (original source at commit):

```bash
bench eval run \
  --tasks-dir benchmarks/programbench/tasks/abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6 \
  --agent oracle --sandbox docker
```

### Validate a task directory

```bash
bench tasks check benchmarks/programbench/tasks/abishekvashok__cmatrix.5c082c6
```

---

## Choosing an agent

Any registered BenchFlow agent works with adapted benchmarks. List them:

```bash
bench agent list
```

Common choices:

| Agent | Key | Auth |
|-------|-----|------|
| Gemini | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` or host login |
| Claude Code | `claude-agent-acp` (alias: `claude`) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or host login |
| Codex | `codex-acp` (alias: `codex`) | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, or host login |
| OpenHands | `openhands` (alias: `oh`) | `LLM_API_KEY` |
| Harvey LAB harness | `harvey-lab-harness` (alias: `harvey-lab`) | Provider key matching model |

The auth column shows each agent's native/default credentials. Provider-prefixed
models can use provider-specific credentials instead; for example, Azure
Foundry models use `AZURE_API_KEY` plus `AZURE_API_ENDPOINT` with prefixes such
as `azure-foundry-openai/gpt-5.5` or
`azure-foundry-anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`.

Any agent can also be run via [ACPX](https://acpx.sh/) by prefixing with `acpx/`:

```bash
bench eval run --tasks-dir tasks/edit-pdf --agent acpx/gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox daytona
```

ACPX is a headless ACP client that adds persistent sessions and crash recovery.
The underlying agent's install, env vars, credentials, and skill paths are all preserved.

The **Harvey LAB harness** agent is special — it runs Harvey LAB's own agent loop
(6 tools, system prompt) inside BenchFlow's sandbox. Use it for parity testing
(same agent on both original and converted tasks).

---

## Choosing a sandbox

| Sandbox | Flag | Best for |
|---------|------|----------|
| Docker | `--sandbox docker` | Local development, small runs (≤10 tasks) |
| Apple Container | `--sandbox apple-container` | Local Apple Silicon macOS runs without Docker Desktop |
| Daytona | `--sandbox daytona` | Cloud runs with concurrency (needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`) |
| Modal | `--sandbox modal` | Serverless, high concurrency (needs Modal auth) |
| AgentCore | `--sandbox agentcore` | AWS-native isolated microVMs (needs AWS credentials) |

Apple Container requires Apple Container 1.1+ on Apple Silicon and runs the model
proxy inside each VM. It supports public-network, single-container arm64 tasks and
has no snapshot support. BenchFlow serializes Apple rollouts within each process
and blocks new VMs when the live `data.kalloc.1024` headroom is unsafe. Avoid
running concurrent BenchFlow processes, because the macOS allocation leak is
system-wide. Use Docker, Daytona, or Modal for `network_mode = "no-network"`,
multi-service, snapshot, or high-concurrency runs.

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

`--sandbox agentcore` runs each rollout in an AgentCore Runtime microVM.
Install the extra and point BenchFlow at an execution role:

```bash
pip install 'benchflow[sandbox-agentcore]'
export BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/<role>"
export BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_REGION="us-west-2"   # optional, this is the default
```

The role must be assumable by `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` and able to
pull from ECR and write CloudWatch logs. Your own credentials additionally need
`bedrock-agentcore:*` and ECR push permissions.

Unlike the other backends, AgentCore cannot take a container image directly:
BenchFlow builds the task image for `linux/arm64`, pushes it to ECR (repository
`benchflow-agentcore`, override with `BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_ECR_REPOSITORY`), and
registers it as an agent runtime. The image is tagged by content digest, so a
task whose environment has not changed reuses the pushed layers and the
existing runtime instead of paying for a rebuild.

#### Building without Docker

By default BenchFlow builds with a local Docker daemon when one is running,
and otherwise builds on **AWS CodeBuild** — so the backend works on a machine
with no container runtime at all, and from CI or Windows. Set a CodeBuild
service role to enable the remote path:

```bash
export BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_CODEBUILD_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/<build-role>"
```

That role must be assumable by `codebuild.amazonaws.com` and able to push to
ECR, read the build bucket, and write CloudWatch logs. Your own credentials
need `codebuild:*` and S3 access. BenchFlow creates the CodeBuild project and
an `benchflow-agentcore-build-<account>-<region>` bucket on first use (build
contexts expire after a day); override the bucket with
`BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_BUILD_BUCKET`.

Builds run on a Graviton worker, so `linux/arm64` is native — no qemu. Force
either strategy with `BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_BUILDER=docker|codebuild|auto`.
A remote build takes roughly 40s versus roughly 20s locally on Apple silicon;
either way it happens once per distinct task image, not once per rollout.

BenchFlow also appends a small HTTP responder to the image and makes it the
entrypoint. AgentCore refuses command execution for a session whose container
does not answer `GET /ping` on port 8080, and task images know nothing about
AgentCore, so this shim is what makes an ordinary task image runnable.

Constraints: `linux/arm64` only, single container (no compose/multi-service
tasks), no snapshot support, and `network_mode = "no-network"` is **not**
enforceable — AgentCore's network mode is either `PUBLIC` or `VPC`, so
BenchFlow refuses no-network tasks on this backend rather than running them
unisolated. The model proxy runs inside the sandbox, as on Daytona and Modal.
Sessions default to a 15-minute idle timeout and an 8-hour lifetime; override
with `BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` / `BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_MAX_LIFETIME_SEC`
if agent turns are long enough to risk reclamation mid-run.

**Running a large matrix.** A rollout is a *session*, not a runtime: one
registered runtime hosts many concurrent, filesystem-isolated microVMs. The
account quotas point the same way — 5,000 concurrent *Active Session Workloads*
against only 100 *Total Agents*, with `CreateAgentRuntime` limited to 5/s. So
BenchFlow builds and registers once per distinct task image (keyed by a digest
of the build context) and every trial and skill arm of that image opens another
session against the shared runtime. Concurrency is therefore bounded by
sessions, not by how many images you have.

Measured against the live service: 60 concurrent rollouts of one task ran on a
single runtime in ~30s wall clock with no throttling and no failures (median
session start ~15s). The session-creation rate quota (400/min) is the first
thing you would hit, well before the 5,000 concurrent-session ceiling.

Two quotas to check before a big run:

| Quota | Default | Adjustable |
|---|---|---|
| Active Session Workloads per account | 5,000 | yes |
| Total Agents (runtimes) per account | 100 | yes |
| **Max image size** | **2 GB** | **no** |

A full 88-task × 2-skill-arm matrix is 176 distinct images, over the default
100-runtime cap — request an increase first. The 2 GB image limit is a hard
service quota: heavy environments (LaTeX, Playwright, large model snapshots)
cannot run here at all, and BenchFlow fails the build with a message naming the
cap rather than letting it surface later as an opaque runtime error. Run those
tasks on Docker or Daytona.

Runtimes are shared, so they deliberately outlive the run that created them —
like a built Docker image. Reclaim them by age:

```bash
bench sandbox cleanup --max-age 1440
```

Only runtimes tagged `benchflow-managed` are ever deleted, and cleanup is a
no-op unless `BENCHFLOW_AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN` is set.

For large-scale runs (100+ tasks), use Daytona or Modal with high concurrency:

```bash
bench eval run \
  --source-repo benchflow-ai/skillsbench \
  --source-path tasks \
  --agent gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --sandbox daytona --concurrency 64
```

> **Daytona has a 10 GB-per-sandbox hard cap.** Tasks with heavy images (large
> HuggingFace model snapshots, Playwright, LaTeX/marker — e.g.
> `latex-formula-extraction`) overflow during bootstrap (`No space left on
> device`) or hang at "Sandbox user agent ready" with no trajectory. Run those on
> `--sandbox docker` (host disk, no cap); keep Daytona for lighter tasks.

## SkillsBench skill-toggle matrix (Opus-4.8 + Gemini) on Daytona

A self-contained recipe for the four-cell matrix of
**`{Opus-4.8 via Bedrock, Gemini-3.5-flash}` × `{with-skills, without-skills}`**,
agent `openhands`, sandbox `daytona`. Each cell produces a complete trajectory
(`trajectory/{acp,llm}_trajectory.jsonl`) plus a verifier reward — but treat a
cell as done only after the audit in [Verifying the batch](#verifying-the-batch)
passes.

### Setup (once per shell)

```bash
# 1. Run the CLI from a benchflow checkout. BenchFlow starts LiteLLM as the
#    provider gateway for Bedrock/Gemini/Azure/etc. Inside the repo, use `uv run bench`.
cd /path/to/benchflow

# 2. A local skillsbench clone, so --skills-dir can point at a task's bundled skills
git clone https://github.com/benchflow-ai/skillsbench
export SKILLSBENCH=$PWD/skillsbench

# 3. Credentials — verify each LIVE first. A dead key shows up only as
#    `openhands ACP error -32603` on the first model call, never a clean auth error:
#      Bedrock: a `converse` call with `Authorization: Bearer $AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` -> 200
#      Gemini:  `.../v1beta/models/<model>:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY`           -> 200
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2 AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# 4. Adaptive thinking for Opus-4.8. Current LiteLLM Bedrock support clamps
#    requested xhigh/max to high, so request the effective value directly.
export BENCHFLOW_BEDROCK_THINKING_EFFORT=high

# 5. Strip stale external gateway vars; BenchFlow will generate its own LiteLLM config:
unset LLM_BASE_URL LLM_API_KEY OPENAI_BASE_URL BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_BASE_URL \
      BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_API_KEY LITELLM_BASE_URL LITELLM_API_KEY
```

> Pick a **light** task — Daytona caps each sandbox at 10 GB (see the note above).
> `citation-check` is a good default; heavy tasks need `--sandbox docker`. Note that
> Opus adaptive thinking can make each turn substantially slower than the
> Gemini cells, so keep the first validation task light.

### Run the four cells

```bash
TASK=citation-check
COMMON="--tasks-dir $SKILLSBENCH/tasks --include $TASK --agent openhands \
  --sandbox daytona --concurrency 1 --usage-tracking required --agent-idle-timeout none"

# (1) Opus-4.8 (adaptive high) — with skills
bench eval run $COMMON --model aws-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8 \
  --skill-mode with-skill --jobs-dir jobs/opus-skill

# (2) Opus-4.8 (adaptive high) — without skills
bench eval run $COMMON --model aws-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8 \
  --skill-mode no-skill --jobs-dir jobs/opus-noskill

# (3) Gemini-3.5-flash — with skills
bench eval run $COMMON --model gemini-3.5-flash --agent-env LLM_CACHING_PROMPT=false \
  --skill-mode with-skill --jobs-dir jobs/gemini-skill

# (4) Gemini-3.5-flash — without skills
bench eval run $COMMON --model gemini-3.5-flash --agent-env LLM_CACHING_PROMPT=false \
  --skill-mode no-skill --jobs-dir jobs/gemini-noskill
```

LiteLLM writes provider call metadata to `trajectory/llm_trajectory.jsonl`;
confirm that the effective adaptive thinking effort is `high` there. Requested
`xhigh` or `max` values are also recorded as `high` after the compatibility
clamp.

| Model (`--model`) | Skills | Cell-specific flags |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| `aws-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` | with | `--skill-mode with-skill` |
| `aws-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` | without | `--skill-mode no-skill` |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | with | `--agent-env LLM_CACHING_PROMPT=false --skill-mode with-skill` |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | without | `--agent-env LLM_CACHING_PROMPT=false --skill-mode no-skill` |

### Verifying the batch

A finished command is **not** a healthy trial. After each batch, audit the
trajectories with the **`benchflow-experiment-review`** skill (repo copy at
`.agents/skills/benchflow-experiment-review`, also reachable through the
`.claude/skills` symlink; see the Experiment-guidance notes in `AGENTS.md`). A
trial counts as healthy only when **every** check passes: complete
trajectory + metadata (timing, token usage, tool usage), correct
pass/fail/timeout status, verifier isolation (verifier starts after the agent
exits), no reward hacking, and the right skill posture — with-skills cells must
show the task skill loaded (`task_skills_loading: 1`), without-skills cells must
not (`task_skills_loading: 0`, and the task skill absent from the trajectory;
generic openhands built-ins such as `.agents/skills` / `invoke_skill` appear in
*every* run and are **not** leakage).

Quick smoke checks before the full audit (per jobs-dir):

```bash
J=jobs/opus-skill
find $J -name rewards.jsonl -exec tail -1 {} \;                                  # reward
grep -ho '"usage_source": "[a-z_]*"' $(find $J -name result.json)                # expect provider_response
grep -ho '"effort": "[a-z]*"' $(find $J -name llm_trajectory.jsonl) | sort -u    # Opus -> "high"
python3 .agents/skills/benchflow-experiment-review/scripts/extract_harness_skills.py \
  "$(find $J -name llm_trajectory.jsonl | head -1)" --task-skill <task-skill-name>
```

Notes:
- `--usage-tracking required` records provider-reported token usage into each trajectory.
- `--agent-idle-timeout none` disables the idle watchdog (the task wall-clock still applies).
- Opus-4.8 on Bedrock needs the adaptive-thinking patch, which LiteLLM loads into its proxy process (`src/benchflow/providers/litellm_bedrock_patch.py`); see `AGENTS.md`.
- For heavy tasks, replace `--sandbox daytona` with `--sandbox docker` — same flags otherwise.

---

## Running a benchmark with an Environment manifest

A **stateful** benchmark — one with mock services, databases, or accounts the
agent acts on — declares its world in an `environment.toml` manifest and runs
on the [Environment plane](./environment-plane.md). Use
`bench eval run --tasks-dir ...` for both single-task and batch
manifest-backed evaluations; `--environment-manifest` applies the manifest to
every rollout in the Job pipeline.

```bash
# single task
bench eval run --tasks-dir benchmarks/clawsbench/tasks/<task> \
  --environment-manifest benchmarks/clawsbench/environment.toml \
  --agent claude-agent-acp --model claude-haiku-4-5

bench eval run --tasks-dir benchmarks/chi-bench/tasks/<task> \
  --environment-manifest benchmarks/chi-bench/environment.toml \
  --agent claude-agent-acp --model claude-haiku-4-5

# batch via the Job API
bench eval run --tasks-dir benchmarks/clawsbench/tasks \
  --environment-manifest benchmarks/clawsbench/environment.toml \
  --agent claude-agent-acp --model claude-haiku-4-5
```

YAML configs may declare the same seam with ``environment_manifest:
<path>`` at the top level so the batch run is reproducible from disk.

`--environment-manifest` is distinct from `--sandbox`: the sandbox is *where*
the rollout runs; the environment manifest is *the world* the agent acts in.
BenchFlow provisions the environment, gates on its readiness before the agent
runs, and tears it down afterward. See [the Environment plane](./environment-plane.md)
for the full manifest schema, both onboarded benchmarks, and the
`snapshot`/`restore` roll-back contract.

---

## Running foreign benchmarks (inbound adapters)

BenchFlow runs benchmarks authored in other formats without converting them
first. An **inbound adapter** translates a foreign task directory into
BenchFlow-native shape; the rollout then runs natively:

| Source format | Signature file | Adapter |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Harbor | `task.toml` | `HarborAdapter` |

`benchflow.adapters.inbound.detect_adapter()` sniffs a task directory and
picks the adapter whose format it matches. The adapter is a pure
`Path -> InboundTask` translation: it reads a directory and returns an
in-memory native task, building no sandboxes and running nothing.

---

## Continual learning (`sequential-shared` job mode)

By default a job runs its rollouts concurrently and isolated
(`parallel-independent`). A **continual-learning** job instead runs them
strictly in order over one persistent, versioned store of memory + skills —
set `job_mode: sequential-shared` in the YAML config:

```yaml
source:
  repo: benchflow-ai/skillsbench
  path: tasks
agent: claude-agent-acp
model: claude-haiku-4-5
job_mode: sequential-shared
```

In this mode each rollout reads the current `LearnerStore` state and, after
it scores, offers its reward as a learning-curve metric: an improvement
stamps a new generation, a regression is reverted to the best generation so
far. Concurrency is ignored — a shared mutable store cannot be written by
overlapping rollouts. See the [architecture doc](./architecture.md#the-eight-capabilities--how-each-fits),
capability 5, for the full design.

## Reading results

Results land under `jobs/<job-name>/<rollout-name>/`:

```
jobs/
└── harvey-lab-gemini-2026-05-06/
    ├── corporate-ma-review-data-room-red-flag-review/
    │   ├── result.json          # verifier output (reward, passed criteria)
    │   └── trajectory/
    │       └── acp_trajectory.jsonl  # full agent trace
    ├── real-estate-extract-psa-key-terms-scenario-01/
    │   ├── result.json
    │   └── trajectory/
    └── ...
```

The `result.json` contains (abridged):
```json
{
  "rewards": {"reward": 0.48},
  "n_tool_calls": 12,
  "n_skill_invocations": 2,
  "agent_result": {"total_tokens": 23993, "cost_usd": 0.07, "usage_source": "provider_response"},
  "final_metrics": {"total_prompt_tokens": 18000, "total_completion_tokens": 5993},
  "error": null,
  "verifier_error": null
}
```

**Canonical fields — read these, not invented top-level ones.** The reward,
token totals, and outcome each live in exactly one place:

| You want | Read | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reward | `rewards.reward` | scalar 0.0–1.0, or `null` if unscored |
| token total | `agent_result.total_tokens` | `null` when no provider usage was captured (e.g. hosted runs) |
| outcome / status | derived from `rewards.reward` + `error`/`verifier_error` | not stored as a field; see below |

There is intentionally **no top-level `reward`, `total_tokens`, or `status`
key** — those names are absent, not `null`. A naive consumer doing
`result["reward"]` or `result.get("total_tokens")` gets `None` because the key
does not exist, never because the value is null. Pass/fail is a *derived*
classification (only `reward == 1.0` passes); BenchFlow computes it from
`rewards.reward` plus the error channels rather than persisting a redundant
`status`. The same nested shape is produced for both native rollouts and
hosted-env runs, so one reader handles both.

`n_skill_invocations` is derived from structured ACP trajectory events: BenchFlow
counts only `tool_call` events whose `kind` is `skill`. Job `summary.json`
also includes `total_skill_invocations` and `avg_skill_invocations` across the
rollouts in the run.

List evaluations:
```bash
bench eval list jobs/
```

## Running parity validation

Parity validation is a **developer/maintainer workflow** for verifying that an
adapter preserves benchmark semantics. These scripts live under each benchmark's
directory:

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/harvey-lab/parity_test.py \
  --mode full \
  --harvey-root .cache/datasets/harveyai/harvey-labs

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... uv run python benchmarks/harvey-lab/parity_test.py \
  --mode eval-parity

GEMINI_API_KEY=... uv run python benchmarks/harvey-lab/parity_test.py \
  --mode side-by-side
```

Recorded parity results are in `parity_experiment.json` and `benchmark.yaml`.

## YAML config reference

Job configs use the two-field `source` pattern to reference remote benchmark repos:

```yaml
# Example: SkillsBench config — direct from remote repo
source:
  repo: benchflow-ai/skillsbench   # GitHub repo (org/repo)
  path: tasks                      # subpath within the repo
  ref: main                        # branch/tag (optional)
agent: claude-agent-acp            # agent from registry
model: zai/glm-5.1                 # model ID
environment: daytona               # sandbox
concurrency: 8                     # parallel tasks
```

All adapted benchmarks use the same `source` pattern, pointing at the
[benchmarks dataset repo](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchmarks):

```yaml
# benchmarks/harvey-lab/harvey-lab-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
source:
  repo: benchflow-ai/benchmarks
  path: datasets/harvey-lab/tasks
agent: gemini
model: gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
environment: docker
concurrency: 4
```

```yaml
# benchmarks/programbench/programbench-gemini-flash-lite.yaml
source:
  repo: benchflow-ai/benchmarks
  path: datasets/programbench/tasks
agent: gemini
model: gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
environment: docker
concurrency: 4
```

You can also use `tasks_dir:` for local paths:

```yaml
tasks_dir: ./my-local-tasks
agent: gemini
model: gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
```

All fields from [CLI reference](./reference/cli.md#yaml-config-format) apply:
`source`, `tasks_dir`, `agent`, `model`, `environment`, `concurrency`,
`sandbox_setup_timeout`, `skills_dir`, `agent_env`, `max_retries`.

## Adding a new benchmark

Use `bench eval adopt <source>` to scaffold and drive the conversion of a new
benchmark into a `benchmarks/<name>/` package, then `bench eval adopt <name> --verify`
to parity-gate it; the conversion guide is embedded in that command. Harvey LAB
(`benchmarks/harvey-lab/`) and ProgramBench (`benchmarks/programbench/`) are
reference implementations.
