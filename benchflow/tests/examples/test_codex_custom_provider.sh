# Test codex-acp routing to a local custom /v1/responses stub.
#
# This is a routing test, not a model-capability test. The run is expected
# to fail with a mocked 401. The test passes if codex-acp sends a request to
# the local stub instead of api.openai.com.
#
# Two deliberate choices keep this a *direct* routing check:
#   --usage-tracking off  — with the default (auto), benchflow stands up its
#       own LiteLLM usage proxy in front of the agent (#587/#613). That proxy
#       would intercept codex's call, fall back to codex's built-in default
#       model, and 400 before forwarding upstream — so the stub would never
#       see the request. Off sends provider traffic straight to the stub.
#       (Usage-proxy forwarding for custom providers is a separate concern.)
#   --model vllm/gpt-5.4  — codex-acp validates the model against its own
#       catalog at session/set_model, so a synthetic id like "mock-model" is
#       rejected with -32603 before any HTTP request. gpt-5.4 is a real catalog
#       id that is accepted but is NOT codex's built-in default (gpt-5.5), so
#       the model assertion below also proves codex sent the *configured* model
#       rather than silently falling back. The stub returns a mocked 401.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/examples/test_codex_custom_provider.sh
#
# Optional env:
#   BENCHFLOW_HOST_ALIAS=host.docker.internal   # override for Linux setups
#   PORT=8765                                   # stub port

# returns the stub's sentinel body ({"ok": true}).
