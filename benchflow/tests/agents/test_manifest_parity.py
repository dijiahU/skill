"""Core <-> manifest byte-identical parity gate (the pre-flip source-of-truth lock).

The agent-decoupling plan moves each agent's *data* out of ``registry.AGENTS``
and into a ``manifest.toml`` in ``benchflow-ai/agents`` (decision #4). Before the
source-of-truth can be flipped (the future "step 6"), every manifest that
reproduces an existing core agent must merge back to a config that is
byte-identical to the hand-authored core entry — otherwise the flip would
silently change behaviour. This test is that gate.

Why a child interpreter for "pure core"
---------------------------------------
``registry.py`` calls ``register_env_manifest_agents()`` at import time, so when
``$BENCHFLOW_AGENTS_DIR`` is set (as the dedicated CI job sets it) the in-process
``AGENTS`` is *already* merged with those manifests. Comparing a manifest against
that merged ``AGENTS`` would compare it against *itself* — a silent false pass
that no drift could ever fail. So we recover the un-merged, hand-authored core
configs by re-importing ``registry`` in a child interpreter with
``$BENCHFLOW_AGENTS_DIR`` *unset* (the proven parity recipe), and compare the
live manifests against that.

What "byte-identical" means here
--------------------------------
A data-only manifest cannot carry the ``_SHIM_ONLY`` AgentConfig fields
(``subscription_auth``, ``credential_files``, ``acp_model_config_id``,
``disallow_web_tools_*``, ...); ``_merge_core_shim_only`` takes exactly those
from the core entry and everything else from the manifest. The merged result
must then equal the core entry on *every* dataclass field — i.e. the manifest's
14 data fields reproduce core exactly.

Lanes
-----
* Default ``pytest tests/`` (env unset): the live checks skip with a clear
  reason; the synthetic-drift test still runs (it is hermetic) so the comparison
  logic is exercised on every push.
* The dedicated parity-gate CI job clones ``benchflow-ai/agents@main``, sets
  ``$BENCHFLOW_AGENTS_DIR``, and runs this file — turning the live checks on.

Relationship to the sibling manifest tests: ``test_manifest_loader.py`` covers
parsing -> AgentConfig; ``test_manifest_dirscan.py`` / ``test_manifest_wiring.py``
cover discovery + registry merge mechanics. This file is orthogonal: it asserts
the *content* parity of the merge's output against the real agents repo.
