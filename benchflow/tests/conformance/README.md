# ACP conformance tasks

Small, deterministic tasks that every registered agent in `src/benchflow/agents/registry.py` must pass before a release tag.

## Tasks

| Task | Covers |
|---|---|
| `acp_smoke/` | ACP handshake · single tool call · file write · terminal reward |

`acp_smoke/` carries a native `task.md` entrypoint while retaining the legacy
split files used by older conformance docs and tests.

## Run

```bash
bench eval run --tasks-dir tests/conformance/acp_smoke --agent <agent-name> --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

Every agent in the registry must return `reward=1` on the smoke task against the oracle solution, and must complete cleanly for Haiku 4.5 as the driving model.

## Gate for 0.3

Release is blocked until every registered agent has at least one green conformance run on record. Agents that can't pass the smoke are either fixed or removed from the registry.
