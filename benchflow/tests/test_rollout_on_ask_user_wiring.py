"""Guards #382 follow-up: ACPSessionAdapter must reach the live runtime.

PR #382 made ``ACPSessionAdapter.on_ask_user`` forward into the ACP client,
but never instantiated the adapter inside ``rollout.py`` / ``connect_acp``.
The correctness reviewer found that ``connect_acp`` returned the raw
``ACPSession`` (no adapter) — so the kernel had nowhere to register a
handler against the live wire path. Every rollout therefore kept running
the unconditional auto-approve policy that pre-#382 callers shipped.

These tests pin two boundaries:

* ``connect_acp`` constructs and returns an :class:`ACPSessionAdapter`
  bound to the live :class:`ACPClient`. The :class:`Rollout` stores it as
  ``_session_adapter`` and exposes :meth:`Rollout.on_ask_user`.
* A handler registered through that path actually fires when an agent
  emits ``session/request_permission`` during a real prompt round-trip
  (driven through the existing mock-ACP-agent stdio fixture so the wire
  is real, not a stub).
