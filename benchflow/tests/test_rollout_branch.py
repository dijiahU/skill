"""Branch -> Rollout engine integration.

A ``Rollout`` builds a ``RolloutTree`` as it executes (a linear rollout is a
degree-1 tree) and can ``branch`` at the cursor: checkpoint the Environment,
fork N children, run each child continuation from the env checkpoint with a
fresh agent session, then aggregate the children's returns into V(parent).

These are unit tests against fakes — no Docker, Daytona, or API keys. The
live e2e is a separate task.
