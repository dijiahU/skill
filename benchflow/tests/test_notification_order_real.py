"""Verify that ACP notifications arrive interleaved (not batched).

This test hooks into ACPSession.handle_update to record the raw
notification order, then runs a real prompt through a mock agent.
It confirms that agent_thought_chunk and agent_message_chunk arrive
BETWEEN tool_call notifications, not all-at-the-end.

This is the critical assumption behind the _flush_agent_text fix for #745:
if notifications were batched, flushing at tool_call boundaries wouldn't
split the text.
