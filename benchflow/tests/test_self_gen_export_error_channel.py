"""Regression tests for #389 follow-up: export-error channel + commit gating.

Two material issues found in PR-#389 review:

1. Channel mix: routing a skill-export failure through ``Rollout._error`` runs
   ``classify_error("Skill export failed: ... connection lost")`` through the
   "looks_like_infra" heuristic and mis-tags the rollout as agent
   ``infra_failure``. That contaminates agent-error dashboards with a
   cleanup-phase event the agent never caused. Fix: dedicated
   ``_export_error`` / ``RolloutResult.export_error`` sibling channel.

2. Learner-store poisoning: ``_commit_learner_generation`` ran unconditionally
   even when export failed but the verifier already produced rewards.
   It would commit an empty/partial skill delta as the next generation. Fix:
   short-circuit on ``result.export_error``, and have
   ``evolved_skills_for_result`` return ``{}`` instead of re-reading the
   half-written export dir.
