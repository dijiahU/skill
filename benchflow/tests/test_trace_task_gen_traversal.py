"""Path traversal regression tests for benchflow.traces.task_gen (issue #376).

Trace file paths flow into three generated artifacts:

* ``task.md`` — the task description shown to the agent
* ``verifier/test.sh`` — the verifier that decides task reward
* ``oracle/solve.sh`` — the oracle that replays trace writes

If trace paths contain ``..`` segments or are absolute, the generated
artifacts encode writes and verification outside the task workspace,
and a Docker oracle can earn reward 1.0 by escaping ``/app``.

The fix drops unsafe paths from each consumer with a warning, so
generated tasks never instruct or verify outside the workspace.
