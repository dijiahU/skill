"""Manifest control points actually steer the sandbox (#395).

A RolloutConfig that carries an EnvironmentManifest must take effect:

1. ``image`` overrides ``task.config.sandbox.docker_image`` so the
   manifest — not the task's local Dockerfile — drives runtime image
   selection.
2. ``task_selection`` (mechanism=env_var, inject_into=entrypoint) binds
   the task id under the configured key so the image entrypoint and any
   subsequent ``sandbox.exec`` call observe it.
3. ``forward_env`` pulls the named host env vars into the sandbox so the
   environment can read declared host secrets/config.

Before this fix the manifest was accepted but ignored — the sandbox was
created from ``task.config.sandbox`` only, the env var never made it
into the container, and host-side ``forward_env`` was never resolved.
