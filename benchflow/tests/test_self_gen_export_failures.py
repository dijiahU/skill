"""Regression tests for self-gen skill export failure propagation.

Guards #389: a configured-but-failed skill export must not be observable as
a successful rollout that "honestly evolved no skills". The cleanup path
used to swallow export exceptions into a warning, leaving ``_evolved_skills``
as ``None`` and ``_error`` empty — indistinguishable from a clean run that
the agent didn't bother to populate. That was a measurement-integrity bug for
the continual-learning Memory-space signal.
