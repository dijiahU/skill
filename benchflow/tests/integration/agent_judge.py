"""Agent-as-judge verification over a completed BenchFlow rollout.

This is BenchFlow's own integration check: after a real ``bench eval run``
run, an LLM judge reads the recorded rollout and decides whether the run is a
trustworthy measurement — the agent genuinely attempted the task, the
trajectory is coherent, and the reward is not the product of obvious
reward-hacking. It is a second, independent signal layered on top of the
mechanical realness gate in :func:`realness_issues`.

The judge is BenchFlow's existing :func:`benchflow.rewards.llm.call_judge`
primitive — the same multi-provider client the verifier plane uses — so this
module adds no new judge client. The prompt is BenchFlow's own, neutral, and
treats the recorded trajectory as untrusted evidence rather than as
instructions to the judge.

Fail-closed contract: if the judge cannot run (no provider SDK, API error,
unparseable verdict, missing verdict field), the verdict is FAIL with the
reason recorded. A judge that errors must never be read as a pass.
